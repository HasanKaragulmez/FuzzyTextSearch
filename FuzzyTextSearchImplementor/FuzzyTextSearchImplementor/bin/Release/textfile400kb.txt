Chapter One: Murder in Irvine

A double killing, a vengeful plan, a wave of fear

Police are baffled by the slaying of a young couple with no known enemies. The more they learn, the more ominous the crime becomes. 



Manhattan Beach
 



The man emerged from a charcoal-gray pickup and approached the hotel check-in counter. He wanted a room and the Internet pass code. He was 6 feet tall, with a weightlifter’s build and military posture. But he could transform his soft, round face into a picture of amiability. He struck the night manager as personable and disarming.

Inside Room 116 of the Hi View Inn & Suites in Manhattan Beach, he stared at his Facebook page and a lifetime’s worth of grudges. It is not clear how long he had labored on the unusual document on the screen.

It was a rambling, free-associating screed in which he asserted firm opinions on politicians, journalists, comedians and television shows. It was a brew of hatreds, a sustained cry of self-pity and self-justification, and a blueprint.

One touch of a button would make it public, once people knew where to look.

It was 1:15 a.m. on Monday, Feb. 4.

Irvine
 



Hours earlier, Irvine Police Det. Victoria Hurtado was crouched in the evening chill, studying an enormous diamond ring on a dead woman’s hand. It was one of her first clues. “This is not a robbery,” she thought.

The victim was in the passenger seat of a white Kia Optima, parked on the rooftop lot of an upmarket condo complex on Scholarship Drive. She was Asian, in a pretty blue dress. Beside her, a young black man was slumped over the steering wheel. Both were riddled with bullets, with fatal shots to the back of their heads.

Stepping carefully amid 14 shell casings scattered on the pavement, Hurtado noticed powder burns around the bullet holes in the windows. It was a close-range ambush, and as cold a scene as the detective had seen in 17 years on the force.

There was no evidence of a fight. It was as if the killer, possessed by an impersonal fury, had not known the victims at all.

Hurtado looked up at the high-rise apartments that towered above the garage. Hundreds of people would have had a plain view of the shooting, if they had peered out their windows. Hundreds should have heard it.

Five floors below, news crews were assembling. Murder was startling news in Irvine, which boasted of being America’s safest midsized city — 65 square miles of gleaming corporate parks and master-planned neighborhoods.

Just after midnight, the department received a call. It was from Randal Quan, a retired Los Angeles Police Department captain. He had seen the news and recognized the condo complex. His 28-year-old daughter, Monica, lived there with her 26-year-old fiance, Keith Lawrence.

Quan had grown increasingly worried. He had been trying to call his daughter. She was not answering. He came to the Irvine police station with his wife and grown son. They were a close family. Detectives led them to a private interview room.

Quan described his daughter. He had seen her earlier that day. She had been wearing a blue dress.



Neither Monica Quan nor Keith Lawrence seemed capable of making an enemy.

He had been a security officer at USC. She had coached women’s basketball at Cal State Fullerton.

A few days earlier, Lawrence had asked her to close her eyes as he led her into their condo. He had arranged rose petals on the carpet in the shape of a heart. He knelt and asked her to marry him.

 

“There’s no one more right for us than each other,” he told her, in a scene captured on tape by her brother. “You are my winning lottery ticket.”

Perhaps because she had grown up as a police captain’s daughter, she was guarded about her personal life, even with the young women she coached. But before a team trip to San Luis Obispo she had displayed the big diamond engagement ring and enjoyed the screams of excitement.

Detectives considered every possible theory. They scoured police logs for reports of road rage, on the chance that an aggrieved driver had followed the young couple home. They talked to neighbors and friends, co-workers and family members.

They asked Randal Quan who might want to hurt his daughter. He had been the first Chinese American captain at the LAPD, and had run a squad targeting Asian gangs. In recent years, he had worked as a lawyer representing cops facing termination.

Did someone hate him enough to do this? Someone he had busted? A disgruntled client?

Quan struggled. He could think of no one. He saw himself as a cop who had been respectful to people he arrested. Even losing clients knew he had fought for them.



No one had heard anything. A police canvas of the condominium complex and surrounding buildings confirmed that baffling fact.

The couple had pulled onto the rooftop during the final dramatic minutes of the Super Bowl, when traffic was light. The entry gate recorded their arrival about 7:30 p.m. But police had not learned about the shootings until 9:10 p.m., when a resident walking to his car spotted a body slumped over the Kia’s steering wheel.
 
Who were they dealing with? A professional hit man? The mob?

How had 14 shots gone unheard? Had everybody been that fixated on the game?

Det. Hurtado would have to wait for ballistics tests to be sure, but she began to suspect that the killer had used a silencer. It was an expensive piece of equipment, the province of Hollywood spies and assassins, not real-world killers.

The possibility carried with it a sense of dread. Who were they dealing with? A professional hit man? The mob?

As the department’s 18-member detective squad scrambled after leads, an investigator visited Cal State Fullerton and found a compelling clue — its significance clear only in hindsight — that someone had been stalking Monica Quan.

A few days earlier, a man had called the athletic department from a blocked number. He said his daughter played for the women’s basketball team, but he was unable to reach her because her cellphone was not working.

He asked for the name of the hotel the team was using during its trip to San Luis Obispo. The request was refused. Would he care to give a callback number? The man hung up.


National City, Calif.
 



About 100 miles south of Irvine, Pedro Ruelas, 32, arrived at Sound Solutions Auto Styling to open for business Monday morning.

Some DUI arrests had cost him his job driving forklifts years back, by his account, and now he worked seven days a week at the small auto-repair lot in downtown National City, a few miles north of the Mexican border. He was the first one in, last one out.

And so, as he did every morning, Ruelas emptied the garbage, wheeling one of the gray trash cans to a small graffiti-scrawled garbage bin in the alley next to the lot.

As he approached the bin, he noticed what looked like police or military equipment lying atop the heap. Most striking was a steel-plated ballistic vest. The shape reminded him of the emblem on Superman's chest.

His first thought was that he might be able to sell the gear. But he reconsidered: The police might want to know about so unusual a find. He flagged down the first cop he saw.


Officer Paul Hernandez pulled on latex gloves and began to look.

One ballistic vest.

Two military-style ammunition cans, each with several hundred bullets.

Two cans of olive-drab spray paint, the kind SWAT members use to camouflage their helmets and rifles.

One military-surplus gasoline container, plastic, empty.

Two mortar-tube containers, empty. One black leather police duty belt, with thigh holsters and an expandable baton.

Two AR-15 magazine pouches.

One dark blue LAPD uniform, extra large.


Watch: Evidence discovered in National City dumpster 

 


“When I looked inside the dumpster, I saw that there was a LAPD uniform that had the nameplate of Dorner on it.”

— National City Police Officer Paul Hernandez

One police officer’s field notebook, with a cover bearing two handwritten names and serial numbers:

DORNER #37381

EVANS #31050

Hernandez placed the gear carefully in his squad car and drove to the station house.

He carried the equipment downstairs to the property room and began labeling the items for storage. Another officer might have simply filed a Found Property report and forgotten about it.

Hernandez feared that another cop had been the victim — that someone had stolen the equipment and dumped it in a panic.

At 10:16 a.m. he told the dispatcher to call the LAPD to run down the names and numbers on the notebook.

The answer came back quickly. There was no Dorner now on the force. But there was an Evans.



In keeping with her prework ritual, Teresa Evans had driven to the beach that Monday morning, drank a leisurely cup of coffee and read the Los Angeles Times on her iPad. She saw a brief story about the double homicide in Irvine.

Evans was 48, with short, dyed blond hair, an 18-year veteran of the LAPD. She was a field sergeant, athletically built but physically unimposing, five feet tall, 115 pounds. On the street, her bulky utility belt made her seem even smaller.

Off duty, she spent much of her time hauling her teenage son and his teammates to soccer practice.

Right now, as she was preparing for her late-morning run on the beach, her phone rang.

“I’m just calling about some property,” Officer Hernandez said.

She listened to the strange account of the discarded items. No, she said, she had not been the victim of a theft.

She heard the name Dorner. Anxiety gripped her.

Christopher Dorner had been her trainee six years ago, she said, a problem cop who had been fired. She had no clue where he was now, or why his gear would be in a National City trash bin.

She and Dorner had shared a patrol car in San Pedro, near the ports. He had been a probationary officer just back from a year overseas with the Navy.

She thought little of his abilities. He was sloppy and ham-fisted. He had accidentally shot himself in the hand at the Police Academy. Once, responding to a “man with a gun” call, he had walked directly toward the suspect without seeking cover.

He told Evans that the LAPD had discriminated against him as a black man, and that he intended to sue. He wept in the patrol car. She saw him as unstable, perpetually angry and frustrated, eager to see racism in every encounter.
 
Dorner was deemed a liar and fired.

After she warned him that he needed to improve his policework, Dorner filed a complaint that she had kicked a handcuffed, mentally ill man in the head and chest during an arrest outside a hotel. During the resulting internal investigation, Evans was put on desk duty and prevented from working overtime or off-duty security jobs. She described the ordeal as a “nightmare.”

The LAPD interviewed hotel employees, who said they had seen none of the alleged kicks. The LAPD found it fatal to Dorner’s credibility that he had waited two weeks after the incident before complaining.

He sat before a Board of Rights hearing in December 2008, accused of making the story up. That session took place on the fifth floor of the Bradbury Building downtown, a place informally called “The Ovens.” It is where, police said, they went to get burned.

Dorner was deemed a liar and fired. Evans knew he held her responsible. She recalled the way he had looked at her during the hearing.

It was not a scowl, not a grimace of anger, but something spookier. Her lawyer described it as the “stare of somebody whose mind is racing 100 miles an hour.”

Armed guards stood watch as Dorner was led from the building.

For the next six months, she had carried her service Glock everywhere. She wore it to the bathroom, to the grocery store, to her son’s soccer games. When she drove home, she circled the block to make sure Dorner wasn’t following her, or waiting to ambush her.

Sooner or later, she believed, he would try to find her.

Evans said goodbye to the National City officer and hung up. She was no longer in the mood for her morning run. She wasn’t sure what to do with the information he had given her, or what it might mean.

She supervised the graveyard shift on Venice Beach that night, the phone call never far from her thoughts.


Point Loma, Calif.
 



“Is anybody going out?”

The man asking the question stood on a weather-beaten old pier at Driscoll’s Wharf, amid the motley fleet of squid and swordfish boats in Point Loma. It was Tuesday morning.

Dockhand Jeremy Smith noticed the stranger’s shaved head, military boots and hulking size, and thought he must be from Naval Base San Diego, a few miles south. He did not look like the ordinary visitor. Big black dude, he thought. That’s way out of place.

Smith, 41, found the stranger friendly and likable.

He did not seem like the hard men he had met during his stints in lockup for DUI arrests, nor like the men he lived with now at a halfway house.

The big stranger gave his name as Mike, and said he would soon be sent to war in Afghanistan. He wanted to get in some fishing first. He was willing to pay $200 to fish in Mexican waters.

 

Smith thought he should help a man heading to war. He led him around the docks, past the stacks of steel-mesh lobster cages and piles of netting, looking for a boat.

Nobody was going out for marlin and swordfish; the water was cold, the fish lethargic. One captain found it odd that a man headed to war would want to spend time fishing, rather than with a woman.

Why not a sport boat? Smith asked the stranger. Why not whale-watching?

“I don’t want to whale-watch,” the stranger replied.

The stranger disappeared and came back with a bag of yellowtail and halibut tacos.

He passed them out to the men on Pier 6 and refused to take their money.

Smith explained that he couldn’t take him out on the water himself, because the terms of his jail release didn’t allow him to leave the harbor. He couldn’t risk being spotted by the Harbor Patrol.

“Nazis,” Smith said.

The stranger sympathized. He had a friend who had been fired from the police force, he said, and he didn’t like cops.


Venice
 



That afternoon, Teresa Evans drove to the LAPD’s Pacific Area station to begin her overnight shift. She suited up and led roll call for the eight officers under her command. She and her crew headed to their cars, preparing their gear.

She overheard a group of cops chatting nearby. The subject was an officer’s upcoming disciplinary hearing. The officer needed strong representation, someone said — a good lawyer like Randal Quan, the former LAPD captain turned attorney.

Quan wouldn’t be available any time soon, another cop said.

“His daughter was murdered.”

The hair prickled on the back of Evans’ neck. She felt vaguely sick.

Until now, she hadn’t known that the young woman shot to death in Irvine two nights ago had been Quan’s daughter.

She remembered that Quan had represented Dorner at his Board of Rights hearing, and she knew that Dorner had blamed everyone involved for his firing, including his lawyer. Was there a connection, somehow, to the stash of Dorner’s gear in the trash bin?

“  This might be crazy.” 
— LAPD Sgt. Teresa Evans

It was a busy night on the Venice beach detail. Fights, drunks, homeless calls. But her mind returned repeatedly to the possibility that Dorner had killed the young Irvine couple.

No, she told herself. It’s too much of a long-shot.

At the station house that night, she paused in her paperwork and told another cop, “Let me run this by you.”

The other cop listened and said, “You’ve got to call.”

By 11:15 p.m. Evans was on the phone with the Irvine Police Department’s watch commander, who called the home of the detective-squad sergeant, who promptly called Evans to hear her story.

“This might be crazy,” she began.



Det. Hurtado arrived at the Irvine station before dawn Wednesday. Her sergeant held out a piece of yellow notebook paper bearing Christopher Dorner’s name.

Hurtado ran it through the databases. He had no criminal record. He was a Navy reservist. He owned a Nissan Titan pickup. He had a house in Las Vegas. He had a mother and sister in La Palma, south of Los Angeles. He owned a lot of guns, including 9-millimeter Glocks. The shell casings at the murder scene had been 9-millimeter.


Watch: No immediate leads in a double homicide 

 


“He had, in a sense, now declared war on law enforcement.”

— Irvine Det. Victoria Hurtado

She sent two detectives to National City to examine Dorner’s gear. They learned that an employee at a second auto shop — just down the alley from the first — had found more of Dorner’s equipment in a trash bin. A SWAT-style helmet. A military-style backpack. A magazine with 9-millimeter bullets.

Detectives located a surveillance camera that showed Dorner pulling into the alley in his Titan early Monday, the morning after the shootings. He could be seen climbing out to toss away the items. He seemed to be in no rush.

He had picked an alley in plain view of the National City police station, as if he had hoped to be spotted and confronted.

Back in Irvine, detectives drafted search warrants for Dorner’s home and his mother’s home. If they found him, they were intent on taking him in. But they were not sure they had enough to charge him with murder.

They sought a stopgap measure, to hold him as the case was being built. They found it in the expandable baton Dorner had cast away. He could be charged with possession of a prohibited weapon. When he lost his badge, he had lost his right to carry it.

Hurtado placed calls to the LAPD, trying to find Dorner’s personnel file. She kept getting voice mails. People were out of the office, or on vacation.

She left her call-back number, and tried to keep the details vague. She had no contacts at the LAPD; as far as she knew, Dorner might still have friends there. If she didn’t proceed cautiously, someone might alert him to her interest.

Then she called Randal Quan, and asked:

Does the name Christopher Dorner mean anything to you?

“  This is a necessary evil that I do not enjoy but must partake and complete... ” 
— Christopher Dorner

She heard silence. Then she heard him gasp and say, “Oh my God. That guy’s crazy.”

Quan explained that he had represented Dorner at his Board of Rights hearing. He said Dorner had blamed him for his firing and was a man obsessed with the concept of his own integrity. He possessed “kind of a hero syndrome,” Quan said.

In her notebook, the detective wrote:

“Hero syndrome.”

Hurtado called one of the slain couple’s friends. During the conversation, an email arrived on her desktop computer. It was from a detective down the hall conducting a Web search. It had a link to Dorner’s Facebook page.

“From: Christopher Jordan Dorner

“To: America

“Subj: Last resort


Read Dorner’s manifesto »
  
“I know most of you who personally know me are in disbelief to hear from media reports that I am suspected of committing such horrendous murders and have taken drastic and shocking actions in the last couple of days,” the posting began.

“Unfortunately, this is a necessary evil that I do not enjoy but must partake and complete for substantial change to occur within the LAPD and reclaim my name. The department has not changed since the Rampart and Rodney King days. It has gotten worse....”

It was 1:59 p.m., Wednesday, Feb. 6. Hurtado hung up and called Quan to tell him he was in danger.

Dozens of detectives were getting the same email, reading it on desktops and smartphones. Down the hall, Irvine’s police chief was meeting with his command staff. The detective sergeant ran over and stuck his head in.

“I need some help,” he said.

Chapter Two: Fear and the City

A deadly threat ripples through the LAPD

By Christopher Goffard, Joel Rubin and Kurt Streeter

Illustrations by Doug Stevens

December 10, 2013


Officers rush to protect targets of Christopher Dorner’s vendetta. His former training officer, guarded at home, fears for her life.



Los Angeles
 



Just after 2 p.m. at the LAPD’s sleek, 10-story glass tower, the phones began beeping furiously.

Police in Irvine, an hour south, had alerted their Los Angeles counterparts to a terrifying Facebook post. Its author, a disgraced LAPD patrolman, had vowed to murder his former colleagues en masse.

His targets ran through the ranks. Patrol officers were targets. Sergeants were targets. Captains were targets. The chief was a target. Families were targets.

It was Wednesday, Feb. 6. An impromptu war room sprang up on the fifth floor of LAPD’s downtown headquarters. Detectives in the robbery-homicide squad tore through Christopher Dorner’s online tirade and tallied the names on a white board. They quickly counted 30 people who needed protection.

Sirens screamed across freeways in every direction. About 200 cops went in the first wave of protection details. Specialized units were the easiest to mobilize, so gang squads went. Vice squads went. Twenty off-duty cops from the elite Metro division went. Ordinary patrol cops went.

The potential victims were scattered across thousands of square miles — across L.A. County’s far-flung suburbs, from its northern edge to deep inside Orange County, from the beach cities in the west to Riverside County in the east.

Every target would get a “scarecrow” detail: At least two cops, uniformed and visible. There was no time to ask permission of the many local police agencies whose territories the LAPD would be entering, no time to debate or negotiate.

Get there! commanders barked into radios and cellphones. Go! We’ll clean it up later!



Dorner’s 11,000-word document, which people began calling “the manifesto,” was all at once a confession, an extended threat and a summing-up of the life its 33-year-old author soon expected to depart.

It was an open letter to America, and a ramble through pop culture, politics and personal grievance.

How accurately the document reflected the facts of his life is unclear. But it vividly illustrated how he perceived his life. He was a prideful man who believed the world had failed to recognize his great gifts. Victimhood was his singular theme.

No one grows up and wants to be a cop killer, he wrote. It was against everything I’ve ever been....

 

Dorner was raised in a series of middle-class cities where, as one of the few black kids, he felt like an outsider: Cerritos, Pico Rivera, La Palma, Thousand Oaks. His mother was a nurse. His father was absent.

In first grade at Norwalk Christian School, he wrote, the principal swatted him for punching a student who had taunted him with a racial slur. The swattings from authority figures continued through junior high, he claimed, when he dared to stand up to bigots.

When he arrived at the LAPD, he wrote, he found it a nest of racists. In the Police Academy, he complained about another recruit’s use of a racial slur and was shunned. On patrol with the LAPD, he complained that his training officer had kicked a mentally ill man, and in response the department conspired to destroy him. He had dared, he said, to violate the Code of Silence.

He vowed to hunt members of the Board of Rights who had heard his case. He would hunt the LAPD hierarchy that had sanctioned his punishment. He was convinced that his former lawyer, Randal Quan, had been loyal to the LAPD rather than to him. He would hunt him and his loved ones.

I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own, I’m terminating yours...

He bragged of his marksmanship and tactical prowess. He would kill Caucasian officers who victimized minorities. He would kill black officers who belittled their Caucasian subordinates and fueled anti-black bigotry. He would kill Latino officers who victimized other Latinos. He would kill lesbian officers who degraded men.

He praised his knee surgeon, President Obama, the first lady’s hairstyle, George W. Bush, Charlie Sheen, Chick-fil-A chicken and Bill Cosby. He told Gov. Chris Christie to go on a diet, and told David Petraeus that his marital failings were human. He told Natalie Portman she was beautiful. He quoted Mia Farrow on the moral urgency of gun control.

He knew he would die, and lamented what he would not get to see. He would miss “The Hangover III,” and told the director not to diminish the franchise with another sequel. He would miss season three of “The Walking Dead.” He would miss Shark Week.



From his 10th-floor office, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck was trying to coordinate the agency’s response and keep his family safe. He called his wife and told her to assemble the family at home, fast.

“He has a vendetta list,” he said. “We’re on it.”

Beck had not been chief when Dorner was fired, but he was the public face of the department. Two of Beck’s kids wore LAPD badges. He ordered them pulled off duty.

Chief Beck, Dorner had written, this is when you need to have that come to Jesus talk with Sgt. Teresa Evans and everyone else who was involved in the conspiracy to have me terminated for doing the right thing....

“  He has a vendetta list. We’re on it.” 
— LAPD Chief Charlie Beck

Studying Dorner’s words, Beck thought, “He’s an injustice collector.” He blamed everyone else for his failures.

Beck was struck by the length of the tirade. This was no fleeting howl of homicidal rage but the chilling product, it seemed, of months-long planning and forethought.

Dorner had invoked the most highly charged controversies of the LAPD’s past. The beating of Rodney King. The Rampart scandal. The specter of Mark Fuhrman.

As chief for more than three years, Beck had helped to transform the 10,000-officer department. In black neighborhoods, its image as an occupying army had abated. Its 11% of black officers now roughly mirrored the city’s demographics.

Yet Beck understood, even at a glance, the combustible elements at play. True or false, Dorner’s accusations would resonate with people predisposed to believe them. And so today the chief turned to his media spokesman and asked:

“Is this the thing?”
 
If the public turned against the LAPD in the days ahead, Beck knew, he would have to take the blame himself.

He did not need to explain. He meant the thing that spiraled out of control so badly that it forced him from his job. He reckoned the odds at 50-50 that it would happen someday.

Everyone who served as chief in the nation’s second-largest city woke up knowing today might be the day.

Beck sometimes wondered what his predecessor, Daryl F. Gates, had thought on first viewing the grainy footage of his white officers beating Rodney King. Beck had been a sergeant on the front lines in 1992 when the cops were acquitted and rioting swept the city.

Gates had been untouchable. Then he was gone.

Now, a man the LAPD had trained was promising to bring war to its doorstep. If the public turned against the LAPD in the days ahead, Beck knew, he would have to take the blame himself.

“None of us bury our past,” he would say. “You don’t bury it. You carry it.” 



Teresa Evans, Dorner’s former training officer, was sitting in her SUV when she got the call. She was outside her home in a Los Angeles suburb, about to leave for her son’s soccer game.

“It’s a credible threat,” an Irvine sergeant was telling her.

She looked around quickly. Would Dorner be coming around the corner, gun blazing? It would be easy for him to find her here. She had to get away, fast.

Her cellphone rang again. Two LAPD captains told her they were sending protection to meet her, and would call her back with a rendezvous point.

“Stay mobile,” they said. “Don’t go home.”

She drove to the soccer field. There, she met her ex-husband and explained. He would watch their son for now. She hoped that if Dorner came, he would come only after her.
 
She still did not feel safe. She feared that Dorner might take aim from a freeway visible from her window.

Back on the road, she checked the mirrors constantly. She recalled Dorner bragging about his experience in military intelligence. Was he monitoring her phone’s GPS? She flipped abrupt U-turns. She pulled onto the freeway, pulled off, pulled on.

She steered with her left hand, so her right could quickly grab her duty Glock, squeezed in its holster between the driver’s seat and the center console.

She called a hotel in Orange County and booked a room. She headed that way.

Her phone rang again. A security team would meet her in a church parking lot near her home.

She drove to the meeting point, but there were no officers in sight. She waited nearby, her gun close.

Then help came screaming down the block, a pack of patrol cars — 10 or more, she guessed — roaring her way.


Soon there were cops with assault rifles in Teresa Evans’ living room, in her kitchen, ringing her house. They drew the curtains and covered the windows with blankets. They shoved the couch against the window of her son’s room, unscrewed the porch lights and deactivated the motion sensors.

She still did not feel safe. She feared that Dorner might take aim from a freeway visible from her window.

You destroyed my life and name because of your actions, he had written. Time is up.

She dumped her Facebook page. She turned off her phone’s GPS tracker.

When her son came hobbling through the door, his ankle injured during the afternoon’s soccer game, she tried to explain the presence of the SWAT team in vague terms.

Something is going on, she said, and everything will be OK.

She did not say, “Someone wants to murder us.”



People who had known Dorner for years were shocked to see his smiling face on fliers and television screens. One of them was a San Diego police officer named Dulani Jackson. He had been friends with Dorner since they had attended Cypress High School.

Jackson, who is also black, said Dorner had complained about being bullied by racists at his former high school in La Palma. Dorner liked to say that if a girl disrespected him, he would beat up her boyfriend. Or take it out on her family.

After Dorner’s firing from the LAPD in 2009, Jackson had driven to Dorner’s home in Vegas to keep him company. He found him in a deep depression. Dorner blamed the LAPD for tarnishing his name and thereby sabotaging his career in the Navy. Only two days before the Irvine killings, the Navy had officially discharged him.

Dorner had abruptly cut Jackson out of his life, with a text citing a litany of long-simmering grievances. He resented that Jackson hadn’t attended his graduation from Southern Utah University. He resented that Jackson hadn’t visited him in the hospital, after he shot himself in the hand in the Police Academy.

Jackson could picture Dorner alone in his Vegas home, isolated from family, cut off from friends, with nothing to do but seethe. He knew that Dorner had started buying silencers about a year ago. That, he reasoned, was probably when he began to plan his murder campaign.

Like Jackson, many who knew Dorner understood that his memory for slights — real or imagined — was vast. He was always adding up the score.

A former girlfriend, Denise Jensen, remembered that he had been a perfect gentleman at first. He liked to open doors for her. He bought her a nice watch and an iPod. In a tantrum, he seized the gifts and gave them to a stranger at a gas station. Worthier of my kindness, he explained.

He made friends effortlessly but turned on them in an instant. “You just don’t know until he starts turning,” Jensen said.

In July 2009, months after their breakup, Dorner logged onto Facebook and used a fake name — “Mike Crawford” — to lure her to a date at a Las Vegas restaurant. He cornered her in the ladies room and left only after staff threatened to call police.

Another ex-girlfriend had posted a warning on the website Don’tDateHimGirl.com, saying: “If you value your sanity, stay away from this guy.” She described him as “super paranoid always thinking somebody’s out to get him.”

When people asked Dorner about the multitude of firearms he kept close at hand, he would reply that trouble might come any time. J’Anna Hendricks, a manicurist who briefly rented a room from him, discovered guns hidden in the couch cushions.

At first, she found him a model of friendliness. He took her to dinner. She was white, and he jokingly called her a cracker. She called him a wheat cracker and said he was the whitest black guy she knew. She thought it was good fun, though she sensed it annoyed him.

One day he invited her to his room and displayed his laptop. On it were naked photos of himself and some of his girlfriends. He seemed to be testing whether she would sleep with him. She left the room fast. Soon afterward, Dorner stormed into her room and screamed, “I want you out tonight!”

In recent months, Dorner had frequented the Lahaina Grill on the outskirts of Vegas, a dimly lit restaurant where he sat with his back against the wall. He drank bottled water and ate sushi, sharing YouTube clips on his MacBook with other patrons and holding forth on politics.

He said he favored background checks for assault-rifle purchasers, including cops. “Hey,” he told a bartender, “we can snap.”


San Diego
 



On Wednesday night, not far from the wharf where he had been trying to charter a boat to Mexican waters, the fugitive walked onto the docks of the Southwestern Yacht Club in San Diego.

The ungated club was at the end of an out-of-the-way, affluent neighborhood. A yacht called Vivere II was moored in slip A20.

Inside, the 81-year-old owner, Carlos Caprioglio, was watching television. He would later tell police that he heard footsteps but was not automatically alarmed. He assumed it was his wife, returning from a trip to Los Angeles.

Then Dorner was there, pointing a black semiautomatic handgun at him. “I don’t want to kill you,” he said, “but you’re gonna take me to Mexico.”

Dorner took hold of the rope that moored the boat to the dock. A boater of even casual experience knew to throw the rope onto the dock. Instead, Dorner threw it into the water.

Dorner ordered Caprioglio to start the boat. The rope became entangled in the prop. They weren’t going anywhere. It seemed to dawn on Dorner that he had botched his plan.

“Take my car keys,” Caprioglio said. “Take my car.”

“I don’t want to be on the streets,” Dorner said.

He found a pair of Caprioglio’s shoes, and removed the laces. He ordered him to lie face-down, with his right cheek pressed to the sun deck. He tied his hands and feet with the laces, stole his cellphone and disappeared.

By the time Caprioglio had freed himself and had summoned help, just before 10 p.m, Dorner was gone.


Los Angeles
 



With SWAT troops sitting in her darkened living room drinking soda, Teresa Evans crawled under her bedcovers Wednesday night. She thought this would prevent Dorner from seeing the glow of her iPhone — just in case he was out there, watching and waiting for his shot.

“He’s going to shoot me through my window and kill me,” she kept thinking.

All night she traded texts with cops and friends, searching for any scrap of news. She knew she wouldn’t sleep.

Her son was down the hall. To make things easier on him, she had assured him: “It’s going to be over by tomorrow.”

This was a mistake she would make more than once.

Chapter Three: Longest Night

On a night of fear, violent ambushes in the streets

By Christopher Goffard, Louis Sahagun, Kurt Streeter and Phil Willon

December 12, 2013


In Corona and Riverside, Christopher Dorner fires on police. At 4 a.m., a doorbell awakens a wife. In Torrance, cops make potentially lethal mistakes.

 

Riverside
 



Michael Crain’s wife demanded one thing of him, whenever he put on his uniform, secured his badge on his chest and patrolled the streets of Riverside overnight.

He had to text her that he was OK. If she woke she could glance at her phone and take reassurance. He thought the ritual was silly, because he might run into trouble five minutes later, but he did it anyway.

On the night of Wednesday, Feb. 6, as he did before every shift, Crain, 34, took pains to shed every vestige of his non-cop identity. He made sure there were no family photos in his wallet, in case it flopped open in a chase. He took off his wedding ring and put it on his nightstand.

In the streets, it was best to be a man without vulnerabilities.

Suspects would see a muscular, buzz-cut, 6-foot-3 ex-Marine. Not a father who coached his 10-year-old son’s baseball team, made his 4-year-old daughter breakfast every morning and learned to tie her ponytail. Not a man who liked the Food Network, Lynyrd Skynyrd and wearing zebra-striped platform shoes to disco parties.

A suspect had tried to follow him home once. This was safer.

Regina Crain had guessed he was ex-military the day they met, from the way he held out his chest and kept his hair high-and-tight. He had left the Marines before 9/11 and felt guilty he hadn’t stayed to fight, but she was glad he had avoided war. Her first husband had fought in Fallujah, and she had seen too many military funerals.

Tonight, she watched him pack his duffel bag for work — backup gun, badge clip, loose change, hair gel, boot polish, Tums. She knew that he liked the graveyard shift, because it was rarely dull, and that he would be disappointed if he came home saying, “I didn’t find any bad guys.”

 

Tonight was his last shift with an officer he was training named Andrew Tachias, and he had reassured her that he was an alert, safety-conscious cop. “He’s good to go,” he said. “I’m basically just teaching him paperwork.”

She stood on the stairway step, to reach him, and kissed him and told him to hurry home. They were approaching their second wedding anniversary. She knew he liked to get to work an hour before his 10 p.m. roll call, so he could dress at his locker and practice quick-drawing his gun.

A fanatic for safety, Michael Crain lectured his family never to leave a purse or a Gameboy in the car in plain view. At the mall, his kids knew to avoid his gun-hand side, in case the wrong person recognized him.

Before she went to sleep that night, Regina Crain checked her Facebook page. She saw that police were chasing someone named Christopher Dorner, an ex-LAPD officer who had vowed revenge against his former agency and had killed two people in Irvine.

She didn’t think much about it. Los Angeles was a full hour’s drive west.

At 11:43 p.m. she texted her husband: “Good night sexy man!”

She knew that if she woke up in the middle of the night, his reply would be waiting for her, assuring her he was OK.
 

Corona, Calif.
 



In the small hours of that Thursday morning, a self-employed repo man stricken with bladder cancer was beginning work about an hour east of L.A.

Lee McDaniel, 49, the son of a retired Cleveland cop, had just left the side of his sleeping wife. Now he pulled his big Chevrolet truck up to a pump at the Arco station on Weirick Road in Corona.

Since the cancer had invaded his cells, he often felt weak, but he was determined not to lie on the couch and wither away. Work kept him busy and got his mind off his illness.

His first eight-hour chemotherapy session was to begin later that morning. He was on the road now because he wanted to exhaust himself, in order to sleep soundly as the machine pumped poison into his arm.

But first he had a few hours’ work to get through, so he activated the gas pump and let it run as he walked into the AM/PM minimart to buy bottles of 5-Hour Energy. Standing in line at the counter, he felt what he described as a “hulking presence” come up behind him.

He turned. The man behind him was as big as a linebacker. They exchanged a quick look. McDaniel thought he looked vaguely familiar — maybe a neighbor, maybe someone he knew from years of coaching Little League.

McDaniel walked back to his truck, holstered the pump and slid behind the wheel. He was pulling past the door of the minimart just as the large man emerged, walking in front of the truck.

Mounted on the hood of McDaniel’s truck were four license plate recognition cameras with telltale lights, the kind police use to track down stolen cars and repo men use to find cars to repossess. He saw the big man notice them.
 
Now, he noticed Dorner watching him, standing at the Titan’s open door, holding something McDaniel couldn’t see.

Their eyes locked. McDaniel saw the man walk toward a charcoal-gray Nissan Titan at one of the pumps. It had a roof rack, aftermarket black rims and tinted windows.

McDaniel had seen the news. He knew Christopher Dorner was driving a Titan.

McDaniel was unarmed but accustomed to confrontations and able to function under stress. He pulled slowly past the Titan, and stuck his head out the window to get a look at the license plate. It started with an 8.

He remembered that Dorner’s plate started with a 7, according to police. His truck was also supposed to be blue, and this one was gray.

McDaniel stopped his truck at the edge of the lot, close enough to escape down the street if the Titan owner pulled a gun. On his smartphone, he brought up a story about Dorner and found the plate police were distributing: 7X03191.

He typed it into his laptop, running it through a plate database. Up came a photo of a gray Nissan Titan. Roof rack, cover. It was the truck at the pump behind him.

The police had the color wrong, and McDaniel assumed Dorner had switched plates.

Now, he noticed Dorner watching him, standing at the Titan’s open door, holding something McDaniel couldn’t see.

McDaniel pulled onto Weirick Road. He made a U-turn. He parked across the street from the gas station.

He thought Dorner might follow him. Instead, Dorner turned right out of the station, hooked another quick right and disappeared.

McDaniel was trying to call police when he saw an LAPD patrol car pull off Interstate 15 and head into the gas station. He flashed his lights, to signal them, and drove over the median to meet them.

The officers were in Corona to protect one of Dorner’s targets. The guy you’re looking for was just here, McDaniel said.
 
Dorner was about 100 feet away, with firepower that vastly overwhelmed them. 

At that moment, the Titan reappeared. Dorner drove past the gas station and pulled onto a freeway on-ramp.

“That’s him,” McDaniel said.

McDaniel saw one of the officers drop his notebook and radio as he hurried to the patrol car. McDaniel picked them up and tossed them into the police car.

The officers followed Dorner onto Interstate 15, heading north, hanging back a safe distance. They were trying to confirm it was Dorner’s truck.

Five miles along, the patrol car followed Dorner down the Magnolia Avenue offramp to the street. Dorner was waiting at the curb beside his parked truck. He opened fire with his assault rifle, riddling the patrol car with .223-caliber rounds.

The officers ducked. They tried to fire back with their handguns, futilely. Dorner was about 100 feet away, with firepower that vastly overwhelmed them. His rounds pierced the squad car’s windshield, punctured a tire, blew out the radiator. It was immobilized in seconds. One bullet grazed an officer’s head. Dorner sped away down Magnolia.

The officers’ radios were out of LAPD broadcast range. They had to rely on cellphones, one of them borrowed from a passing motorist. The delay probably cost minutes in sending a warning.

The 911 call went in at 1:24 a.m.
 

Riverside
 



About 10 miles east, Michael Crain and his trainee, Andrew Tachias, were sitting at a red light in their Riverside Police Department patrol car. It was foggy at the intersection of Magnolia and Arlington avenues.

They had ridden together a month, and shared an easy camaraderie. Tachias had plans to marry. His father was an L.A. County sheriff’s deputy, who had excited his son’s boyhood imagination with stories of the job and then tried to talk him out of wearing a badge because of the toll it took on a man’s personal life.

Tachias’ favorite film was “End of Watch,” a violent, harrowing cop drama about a pair of L.A. cops on the job. He watched it before shifts, to psych himself up.

Tonight, Tachias was in the driver’s seat, Crain in the passenger seat. To their left, also stopped at the red light, a 42-year-old Riverside man sat in a Chevrolet Cavalier with flaking paint and missing hubcaps. He was a food-truck driver returning home from work. He glanced at Tachias, who smiled, looking like a man who loved his job.

It was just after 1:30 a.m. Inside the squad car, the radio crackled with news: Dorner was in the area and headed their way.

Parked at the red light, on the other side of the intersection, a 33-year-old man named Karam Kaoud was sitting alone inside a white Crown Victoria with the words BELL CAB CO. on the door.

A Palestinian raised in Dubai, Kaoud had been an American citizen for four months and driving a cab for six. He had a degree in mechanical engineering from Cal State Northridge, but couldn’t find work in the field.

So he put in 15-hour shifts in his father’s cab, often covering 400 miles across Riverside and San Bernardino counties. It was supposed to be temporary.

His father worried about graveyard-shift muggers and crazies. He had called this morning and said, “Please be careful.”

“Inshallah,” Kaoud had replied. God willing. “Don’t worry, Dad.”

A devout Muslim, the cabbie kept the Koran in the glovebox and prayed five times a day. When he couldn’t get to the mosque, he removed the car’s floor mat and flipped it over on the pavement of a quiet parking lot. Then he knelt, a smartphone app pointing him to Mecca.

He lived with his wife, parents, two sisters and his four-month-old son. He had just dropped off a customer at a Denny’s and decided to head to a downtown Riverside restaurant to wait for fares.

As he pulled out of the restaurant parking lot onto Madison Street, he debated which way to go. It made sense to turn right, which would take him to the 91 Freeway and get him there fast. It didn’t make sense to turn left, because the stoplights on Magnolia might cost him three extra minutes.

For reasons he couldn’t explain, he had turned left. That is why he was here at this hour, facing a Riverside police car across an intersection.

He noticed Officer Crain sitting bolt-straight in the passenger seat, completely still.

He was preoccupied with his GPS when he half-noticed the Nissan Titan pulling up on his right. Then he saw the Titan moving forward, as if the light had turned green.

Reflexively, he took his foot off the brake and began to follow. Then he stopped. The light was still red. He watched the Titan cross the intersection and pull up beside the food-truck driver’s Cavalier and the patrol car. At first, he did not understand what he was seeing.

He watched the cold air warped by the heat from a rifle muzzle, just outside the open window of the Titan’s driver’s-side window. The driver was firing over the hood of the Cavalier at the patrol car, in quick, muted bursts.

Within seconds, the Titan was pulling away down Magnolia.

The bullet-riddled patrol car rolled slowly into the intersection.

The cabbie jumped out. Inside the patrol car, he saw the wide-open eyes of Officer Tachias as he sat paralyzed behind the wheel, struggling to breathe, his foot off the brake. He noticed Officer Crain sitting bolt-straight in the passenger seat, completely still.

The cabbie had not heard the name Dorner, and he avoided trouble. He did not know if he could touch a police car; he might be sued. Still, he reached into the car and forced the gear shift into park, producing a grating sound as the car stopped.

He touched Tachias’ shoulder and asked what he could do.

“The radio,” the policeman managed to say. “The radio.”

The cabbie reached for the walkie-talkie at Tachias’ side.

“The other radio,” the policeman said. He meant the walkie-talkie on the dashboard.

The cabbie grabbed it. He pushed the button on the side. He held it to Tachias’ lips. Tachias struggled to form the words.

“Officer down,” he said. He looked at his motionless partner.

The cabbie knew how to work the radio, because he had one just like it, but in his fear his finger was frozen on the button. His eyes darted around the streets. What if the shooter returned? What if there was more than one of them? He noticed the gun on the policeman’s belt. He might have to grab it to defend himself.

“Release your hand,” Tachias said.

He obeyed. A dispatcher said help was on its way.

The cabbie looked at Tachias and knew he was dying. He told him to hang on. He saw the lights of a police car, speeding toward him on Magnolia. He held his hands in the air to show he was unarmed.
 
He noticed Dorner had been wearing a heavy camouflage jacket and wraparound goggles. It looked like he had been grinning.

He saw two policemen staring in at Crain, then exchanging a look that told him the officer was dead. He saw rescuers pull Tachias onto the ground and heard him say “I’m cold, I’m losing my breath,” while a policeman said, “Keep talking to him.”

Judging from the .223-caliber casings found at the scene, Dorner had fired at least 13 times with his armor-piercing assault rifle. Both officers were rushed to Riverside Community Hospital. Tachias slipped in and out of consciousness. Bullets had struck him in the back, legs and arms, blowing out his shoulder.

Crain had no pulse. Rescuers worked on him frantically for half an hour before pronouncing him dead, but he had probably died right away.

Seven rounds had struck him. They grazed his head, hit his shoulder and thigh, and severed his jugular vein.

One bullet had pierced his badge, ripped through his ballistic vest, and punctured his heart. He had not drawn his gun.

Dorner had disappeared again. The Cavalier driver, Jack Chilson, had tried to pursue him but had grown afraid and stopped.

From just feet away, he had seen Dorner firing at the patrol car. He had seen the bullets punch a circle in the window the size of a paper plate.

He noticed Dorner had been wearing a heavy camouflage jacket and wraparound goggles. It looked like he had been grinning.
 

San Diego
 



About 40 minutes after the shooting, a shuttle driver near San Diego International Airport saw a wallet in the road and stopped to pick it up. Inside was a photo ID of Dorner and an LAPD detective’s badge.

The badge turned out to be real, but it was not Dorner’s. He had never been a detective.
 
 Was he playing some kind of game, taunting police with scattered clues? 

Share this excerpt

The detective who had earned it was dead; the widow could not recall how it had vanished.

Police guessed that Dorner had probably purchased it from a police-memorabilia dealer, and had used it to masquerade as a detective.

Why had Dorner dumped the wallet here, on a well-traveled route where it was likely to be spotted? Did he want them to believe he had flown out of town?

Why, soon after his first killings, had he dumped his police and paramilitary gear in two National City trash bins? Had he been scuttling possessions in hopes of fleeing the country? Or was he playing some kind of game, taunting police with scattered clues?
 

Torrance
 



About 5 a.m. Thursday, three and a half hours after the shooting, about 60 miles west of Riverside, an aluminum blue Toyota Tacoma rolled slowly down a wide, well-lit street in Torrance.

In the back seat was Emma Hernandez, 71, who was handing copies of the Los Angeles Times and Wall Street Journal to her daughter, Margie Carranza, 46, who was driving with one hand and tossing papers onto porches with the other.

They were both small women, the mother under five feet tall, the daughter just a little taller. They were from El Salvador and spoke little English.

They had risen that morning in a Torrance tenement with a graffiti-scratched elevator. Hernandez shared the single bedroom with her granddaughter; Carranza slept in the living room near her teenage son.

The women were squirreling away money so that the boy could afford college. They did the two- and-a-half-hour shift seven days a week, 365 days a year, and held down separate jobs as housecleaners.

They drove to the newspaper distribution center to pick up their stack of 400 papers, and began their route. Their custom was to drive with headlights and hazard lights on.

The daughter noticed a police car parked at the corner of Redbeam Avenue and Norton Street, all four doors open, with no officers in sight. She was apprehensive. She never saw police here.

The women did not know that a team of LAPD officers was on the block guarding the house of a captain who had been targeted in Dorner’s manifesto. The police also had just received a radio call that a truck resembling Dorner’s had left the freeway and was headed their way.

The daughter told her mother to stand beside her, fearing they would now be executed.

The truck windows were open, and yet the women heard no orders to stop, no commands to surrender. They heard only the sound of gunfire exploding through the truck.

Glass shattered, and the air filled with splinters of plastic. Bullets flew through the seats, the headrest, the glass. “I am just the newspaper woman!” the daughter yelled, but the shots kept coming.

In the back seat, the mother saw her daughter’s head sway from side to side, and feared she would be shot in the head. “No tengas miedo!” she cried. Don’t be afraid.

She hugged the back of her daughter’s seat, to shield her from the barrage of bullets. She did not want her grandchildren to lose their mother. “God have mercy on our souls!” she said.

One bullet went in high on the right side of her back, and emerged just above the collarbone. Another bullet struck her lower back, close to the spine. A small fragment of glass flew into her eye.

Neither woman could tell how long the shooting lasted. By one estimate, police officers — eight of them — fired more than 100 rounds, and 30 of them missed the truck altogether.

Police yelled at the women to get out with their hands up. The terrified women emerged. The daughter told her mother to stand beside her, fearing they would now be executed.


The police looked at the women and seemed to realize their mistake.

“Why did you shoot at us?” the daughter asked. They heard no explanation, no apology.

The mother was able to stand, but she felt blood pouring down her back. “I’m hurt, I’m hurt,” she said. She wondered why police did not inspect her wounds or render first aid.

When an ambulance arrived, she bickered with paramedics who wanted to remove her shirt. Her daughter told her it was necessary.

Neighbors had been awakened by the gunfire, and some had crawled to their windows to peek outside. Bullets had sprayed cars and houses, roofs, garage doors, trees, windshields, bumpers, front doors.
 
“  Why did you shoot at us?” 
— Margie Carranza

One man heard bullets striking his front door, groped for the phone and demanded the police. The dispatcher said: They are already there.

One man found five bullet holes in the entryway to his house and voiced a common sense of bafflement. “How do you mistake two Hispanic women, one who is 71, for a large black male?”

Only a few blocks away, Torrance police had stopped a black Honda Ridgeline pickup truck. The driver, David Perdue, was a 38-year-old baggage handler at LAX. He was going to pick up a friend for a morning of surfing.

Police questioned him and told him to turn around. As he was driving away, another Torrance police car raced up and broadsided him. His airbags exploded. An officer began firing at him. Three bullets flew through his windshield but missed him. He was ordered to the pavement at gunpoint. He would complain of a concussion, spine trouble and pain that left him unable to work or lift his kids.

A white man of medium height and build, he looked nothing like Christopher Dorner.

In their attempt at an explanation, Torrance police said its officers had been responding to the shots fired by the LAPD nearby. They had perceived the surfer as a threat.
 

Riverside
 



Regina Crain had a nightmare once, after one of her husband’s colleagues on the Riverside Police Department had been killed on the job.

In the dream, she was with her husband in the kitchen, and he said, “You can’t keep doing this, Gina,” and she suddenly knew he was a ghost conjured from her longing. She woke up screaming and turned on the lights so she could see that he was alive.

“A cop-wife dream,” she called it.

Now the doorbell rang. She went down the stairs. Voodoo, her labrador, and Pandora, her Rottweiler, were barking madly, ready to maul whoever was at the door at 4 a.m.

When her first husband was away fighting in Fallujah, she had come to dread late-night visits. She knew what they meant. She had been to dozens of Marine funerals. She had once watched a casualty-notification team walk up to a neighbor’s house.

As she walked to the front door, she hoped the neighborhood was on fire. An evacuation order. Anything.

She looked through the peephole and saw a police shield and she knew.

She opened the door and saw one of her husband’s friends, a sergeant. The Riverside chief was standing behind him. She told them it was a dream. She tried to close the door on them. The sergeant put out his hand and said, “No, Gina, it’s real.”

He asked her to put away the dogs. She took the dogs upstairs and came back down and let the police officers in. She demanded that they say her husband was fine, he was hurt and in the hospital but fine.

No.

Did he suffer?

No. It was quick.

Suddenly she remembered her phone. She raced upstairs and grabbed it. Michael Crain had sent his last text at 1:09 a.m., 25 minutes before he was shot. He had been thinking of her.

There was only one word:

“Night.”

Chapter Four: A Killer Vanishes

Charred truck on icy road draws pursuers to Big Bear

By Christopher Goffard, Joel Rubin and Louis Sahagun

Illustrations by Doug Stevens

December 13, 2013


One resident reports seeing the elusive Christopher Dorner, who some are beginning to view as a folk hero.

 

San Bernardino
 



Det. Alex Collins was up early, with his wife and new baby, and found one story dominating the news. The reports made clear that Christopher Dorner was no longer hunting just the network of people he blamed for his firing from the LAPD. Fleeing east out of L.A. County, he was shooting anyone with a badge.

Collins was a boyish-looking 26 with an air of earnest innocence. He had married his high school sweetheart. He was the youngest of three brothers, and had followed both of them into the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.

Now, Collins thought of the suicides he had seen during his years patrolling Big Bear. People sought out the isolation of the mountains to end their lives. He wondered if that might be Dorner’s plan.

It was Thursday, Feb. 7. Collins wasn’t supposed to be working. He had been on leave for two and a half weeks, for his son’s birth. His hair was longer than he liked it, and he had grown a beard.

It was still morning when his phone rang. It was his oldest brother, a patrol sergeant in Big Bear. He had information that had not yet made the news.

“Hey, I think we found Dorner’s truck,” he whispered. He was calling from an ice-covered mountain road where an abandoned Nissan Titan sat charred and smoldering.

Collins felt the impulse to go in. He called his other brother, who was on the SWAT team. Over the phone, he could hear him flooring his accelerator as he raced up the mountain.

Collins shaved. He put on his suit and tie.

His mom called to check on the baby. He told her he was going to follow his brothers up the mountain. He would not be able to live with himself if one of them got hurt and he was not there to help.

She sounded nervous. All three of her sons would be hunting a cop killer.

“I gotta go,” he said.


Big Bear Lake
 



The lock on the gate of Forest Service Road 2N10 had been snipped with bolt cutters. It lay in the snow.

The road started at an altitude of 7,000 feet and wound steeply up a mountain, parallel to the Snow Summit Mountain Resort’s popular skiing and snowboarding slopes. A snowplow driver had found the truck blocking the road about 8:30 a.m., about a mile up the narrow path.

From the tire tracks in the ice, it seemed clear the driver had slid backward on his way into the mountains and found himself impossibly stuck. Deputies surmised that he had used propane to set a fire in the cab, and abandoned it in haste.

Inside the truck, deputies found the blackened parts of two AR-15 assault rifles, a charred portion of a Glock handgun, and the remains of a tent, a survival knife and a camping stove. Scattered through the truck, and in the surrounding snow, were hundreds of high-caliber rifle rounds that had exploded in the fire.


Deputies realized it could be a trap. If this was Dorner’s truck, he might be in the trees now, watching them through his sniper scope. They pulled back and brought in SWAT to search the woods. An armored truck extricated the Titan from the ice, and a tow truck carried it to the resort’s parking lot.

The license plate was missing, but detectives found the vehicle-ID number deep inside the truck, on a piece of steel riveted to a plate between the engine block and the cab. It was Dorner’s truck.

What had Dorner been doing up here? Had he hoped to hide on the mountain? Did he know that it was law-enforcement appreciation day at Snow Summit, and cops would be all over the slopes? Had he planned to find a sniper perch and kill some of them?

Within hours, hundreds of law officers had coalesced on the mountain. Helicopters landed, and more SWAT members poured out. Checkpoints and roadblocks sprang up, resorts were closed, and businesses went into lockdown.

“What a scary morning for me... that’s for sure.”

— U.S. Forest Service employee Bill Crews

Dorner had an hours-long head start. He might be anywhere up here, or long gone. He might have hitchhiked off the mountain. Was the torched truck part of a diversion? Or had he burned it in panic?

Helicopters criss-crossed the mountains. Big Bear Lake had thousands of homes, many of them vacant. Searchers in ski masks crept between cabins, guns drawn. They looked in one-room shacks and in sprawling vacation homes, in campgrounds and in Depression-era cabins. They crept up long uphill driveways without cover.

Late that day, as the wind picked up across Big Bear, investigators interviewed a 45-year-old woman named Reyna Eblin, who lived down the hill from where Dorner had abandoned his truck. She said she had spotted him from her driveway that morning.

Shielded from view behind her truck, she had watched him walk down the middle of the road, in Army boots and camouflage pants, carrying something stiff under his jacket.

Bloodhounds bounded into the surrounding woods. They had Dorner’s scent, sucked from a washcloth he had left in a hotel, but could not find his trail.

Darkness fell across the mountains and the cold deepened. The cloud cover and the high trees blocked the moon.

Locals stocked up on food, barricaded their doors and kept their guns and rifles close.



Like the Santa Ana wind that envelops millions of disparate Southern Californians in its grip, a sense of unease pervaded workaday rhythms across a vast region. On TV, on news blogs, on social media, the story of the fugitive L.A. cop gone rogue became a point of frenzied interest.

Reporters stood in the snow with microphones, updating viewers on every turn in the search. Carnage of any scale, at any place, now seemed thinkable.

On the way to work, drivers could see police staking out one freeway on-ramp after another. The thin blue line was usually invisible. Suddenly it was omnipresent and fearsomely armed. It felt like someone else’s country.
 
“  Of course he knows what he’s doing. We trained him.” 
— LAPD Chief Charlie Beck

Police were scared. They strapped on ballistic shields and checked their guns. They sent kids to the homes of trusted friends, erasing visible links to loved ones, yanking vacation photos from Facebook. They walked to their cars in pairs, and drove home watching the rearview mirror.

People who looked like Dorner, even vaguely, were also scared. One of them wrote on his T-shirt: “NOT CHRIS DORNER PLEASE DO NOT SHOOT.”

On CNN, Anderson Cooper announced that his staff had received a package from Dorner a few days earlier. Inside was an LAPD memento coin with a bullet hole in it.

Former LAPD Chief William J. Bratton had given Dorner the coin, to honor his military service, and had later approved his firing. But he told Cooper he didn’t remember Dorner.

“He clearly has a beef with you,” Cooper said.

“A lot of police officers get discharged,” Bratton said.

On billboards and fliers, TV screens and Internet posts, Dorner’s face was everywhere. In every photo, he seemed to wear a huge smile.

“Of course he knows what he’s doing,” LAPD Chief Charlie Beck told the press. “We trained him.”
 

Norwalk
 



To coordinate the manhunt, authorities established a command post at a secretive facility in Norwalk. It was called the Joint Regional Intelligence Center, or JRIC, which occupied a nondescript office building and was meant for large multi-agency operations, including terror attacks.

Now it was a 24/7 nerve center of ringing phones and clicking computers, a bustle of local, state and federal agencies — including more than 40 detectives — dedicated to catching Dorner.

For the U.S. marshals, who were part of the team, Dorner represented an unusual quarry in that he lacked a criminal record, which meant he had no known network of accomplices. Agents watched his mother and sister, in case he reached out. They monitored his cellphone, his bank account and his credit cards. But he had gone off the grid.

Thomas Hession, chief of the marshals’ fugitive task force, was optimistic that Dorner would be captured. The question was how many people would die first. “The fugitive that completely drops off the face of the Earth is one in a million,” Hession said. “People are creatures of habit.”

That is why, he said, so many high-speed chases ended in the suspect’s driveway, and why he once caught a killer who couldn’t give up a favorite dry-cleaner. Dorner would probably stick to one of the places he knew, like Nevada, California or Utah. And sooner or later, wherever he was, he would make a mistake.

At the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, which was leading the search of the mountain, detectives wondered: Was Dorner nearly as good a tactician as he portrayed himself to be? Had the military given him specialized guerrilla or cold-weather training?
 
 Again and again, detectives saw the gap between Dorner’s boasts and his achievements.

The Navy said he had gone through basic combat training, and was an expert marksman, but otherwise had not been drilled in special tactics. He had guarded an oil rig at sea, but had not been in battle. He had flunked out of flight school. He had failed to get promoted and skipped the required drills. Somehow, he had managed to get out with an honorable discharge.

Again and again, detectives saw the gap between Dorner’s boasts and his achievements. In his attempt to impress women, he had falsely claimed to be an Internal Affairs investigator, a narcotics officer or a SWAT team member. He had displayed grisly war photos, passing himself off as a combat vet.

His LAPD record showed that he had struggled through the academy — it took him 13 months to graduate, rather than the customary six. He had punched one recruit and tried to choke another. He had fired a bullet into his own hand. Even in his 30s, he admitted to friends, he relied heavily on his mother for financial support. In his flight from the law, he had been unable to steal a boat from an 81-year-old man.


Riverside
 



On Friday, cabdriver Karam Kaoud drove to Riverside Community Hospital and parked.

He walked up and found a security guard. He wasn’t family, he explained, but he wanted to know if he could see the young Riverside police officer who had been shot by Dorner the day before.

He didn’t say that he had witnessed the shooting, and that he had used the police radio to help save Officer Andrew Tachias’ life.

The guard left and came back and said no. Tachias was under guard.

Back in his cab, Kaoud called Riverside police. Would they let him see the officer?

The dispatcher who answered the phone asked if he was related.

“No,” he said. “I just wanted to know if he is OK. This is important to me.”

“He’s getting better.”
 

Big Bear Lake
 



Det. Alex Collins had joined the search on the mountain. He was in his detective’s suit and tie, freezing. He and his partner set up motion-sensing cameras, bolting them to trees and telephone poles.

Collins and other detectives searched cabins for surveillance cameras, hoping that one of them had captured Dorner. They studied video footage from gas stations, hoping that Dorner had been seen pumping gas. They searched the trunks and back seats of cars coming and going on the mountain. Nothing.

As night fell Friday, searchers trudged back to the command post after 14-hour shifts in a state of taut-nerved alertness. Their exhaustion was exacerbated by the knee-high snow, 60-pound vests and the thin, high air. Now, with snow piled up to the doors of their trucks, they passed around shovels.
 

Los Angeles
 



As the manhunt wore on, the LAPD’s threat-assessment team — including detectives, commanders and the department’s top shrink — met twice a day in the big, wood-paneled conference room on the 10th floor of headquarters.

On the white board, the names of potential targets had grown to 77. Protection details were working 12- to 14-hour shifts.

Traps were set outside the houses of some top-level targets. A single black-and-white would be stationed outside, to give Dorner the impression of light protection. Positioned in the surrounding neighborhoods were 16-man undercover teams.

This required officers with specialized training, however, and their ranks were fast depleted.

Some people on the target list felt stifled by their guards, and wanted to be left alone. Most stayed in town, a fact that didn’t surprise the department’s head psychologist, Kevin Jablonski. “They are armed,” he said. “Their personalities say, ‘Don’t run.’ ”
 
“  He’s delusional. But don’t make him a Looney Tune.” 
—LAPD psychologist Kevin Jablonski


Share this quote

The psychologist thought Dorner was hunkered down in a cabin in Big Bear, “not hidden in the snowbank like James Bond.” He tried to make sense of Dorner’s actions. The attempt to get to Mexican waters. The drive into the mountains. The abandoned truck. Were they part of a master plan? Or were they the actions of someone in way over his head and prone to panic?

Jablonski studied Dorner’s language and saw a man who expected to die. He advised the San Bernardino County SWAT team to assume that he was booby-trapped, should he appear to be surrendering. They should approach him as if he would fight to the last breath.

He had some advice for his own department. Don’t use the terms “mentally ill” or “psychopath” in public about Dorner, he explained. It might further inflame him.

“This guy doesn’t want to be blamed for anything that’s going on,” Jablonski said. “He’s delusional. But don’t make him a Looney Tune.”

Chief Charlie Beck and his spokesman heeded the advice, but it did not stop others from pronouncing publicly on Dorner’s mental health. “He’s entitled, he’s narcissistic,” said one former police psychologist. Another added that he suffered from a “psychiatric illness.”

Jablonski had more advice for his chief: Announce that the case leading to Dorner’s firing would be reopened. This might give Dorner some pause, maybe enough to catch him.



In one sense, Dorner’s killings had already achieved their desired effect. People were reading his splenetic screed, and more than a few had already bought into his self-portrayal as a righteous man wronged.

On Facebook, pages had sprung up praising Dorner as a folk hero who had dared to defy the law enforcement establishment. Police were portrayed as gangsters in uniform who had again shown their disregard for civilian life in the two Torrance shootings.
 
To the people hunting him, Dorner’s lionization was an outrage.

“Christopher Dorner For President,” one page was entitled. Another admirer called him “Chocolate Rambo.” On social media, people vented about bad experiences with police, unjust workplaces, lost jobs, lying bosses, discrimination.

To many familiar with the history and culture of the LAPD, some of his accusations seemed plausible, at least on their face. He claimed the agency had railroaded him for reporting a supervisor’s misbehavior. Others had complained about such retaliation for years, citing a Blue Wall of Silence that forbade cops to snitch on other cops.

He portrayed the agency as a caldron of racism, and this resonated among those who remembered the Rodney King beating, the aggressive round-ups of black men during the gang wars of the 1980s, and LAPD Det. Mark Fuhrman, whose incendiary racist rants surfaced at the O.J. Simpson murder trial.



To the people hunting him, Dorner’s lionization was an outrage. For his first victim, they pointed out, the supposed crusader for racial justice had selected a defenseless young black man and shot him in the back of the head.

Riverside Police Chief Sergio Diaz, who had stood over Crain’s body at the hospital, called support for Dorner “ignorance and hate masquerading as intellectualism.”

There was nothing ambiguous about it, Diaz said. He was a murderer, plain and simple. “For this knucklehead, this cockroach to become an icon....”

Some of the lawmen hunting Dorner studied his manifesto for clues about what he might do next.

Justin Musella of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s SWAT team concluded that Dorner would probably stay hidden until the heat died down. “We have to handle him totally separately from anything we’ve ever dealt with,” he said.

His SWAT colleague, Chad Johnson, read a few pages and tossed it aside. Its author had hunted down and murdered a man’s daughter.

“That’s all you need to know,” he said.
 

Big Bear Lake
 



On Saturday morning, Det. Alex Collins and his partner methodically checked the cameras they had spread around the mountain. No hits.

The sky over the mountain was a marvelous blue. Tourists were coming back, lured by the promise of 18 inches of fresh snow. They reasoned that Dorner must be gone.

Helicopters continued to criss-cross the mountains with cameras so sensitive they could detect a rabbit from the air. No sign.

Collins and other detectives visited utility companies, trying to determine if any of the cabins had seen a sudden spike in water, gas or electricity.

An address in Big Bear Lake jumped out, and soon Collins was in a helicopter looking at footprints in the snow around the cabin.

SWAT went in by Snowcat. No Dorner.
 

San Gabriel Valley
 



Charlie Beck was waiting for the shooting to start again.

An elite team of officers was guarding his home, set on two acres of winding horse trails at the end of a San Gabriel Valley cul-de-sac. At night it grew bitterly cold. He put space heaters in the garage for them; his wife brought cookies.

Beck’s three grown children were staying at the house, two of them cops themselves. “I need you guys to take care of each other,” he told them. “Think of yourself as a line of defense.”

Beck saw the adulation for Dorner as partly a reflection of Americans’ deep-rooted affection for anti-heroes. A lone rebel versus the LAPD’s Evil Empire — people who cheered Dorner seemed to want the story to fit that convenient template.

The real story was something else, thought Beck. It was about a failed cop, angry and paranoid and perhaps mentally ill, who blamed everyone but himself for his shortcomings.

On Saturday, the fourth day of the manhunt, Beck announced that he would reopen Dorner’s termination case. It was “not to appease a murderer,” he said, but to assure people that the LAPD was “fair and transparent.”

“I am aware of the ghosts of the LAPD’s past,” Beck said, “and one of my biggest concerns is that they will be resurrected by Dorner’s allegations of racism within the department.”
 

Los Angeles
 



The announcement stunned Sgt. Teresa Evans, who had been in hiding with her teenage son for four days. The whole case stemmed from Dorner’s accusation — determined by the LAPD to be a lie — that she had kicked a suspect.

She felt betrayed. Would she have to relive what she called the “nightmare”? For most of a year, she had been forced to work behind a desk, barred from earning overtime as she tried to clear her name.

“Are they saying they don’t believe me now?” she asked her lawyer over the phone.

Her lawyer said the chief was playing to public perceptions.

Evans wondered how long it could possibly continue. The first day she had felt too vulnerable at home. Reporters were assembling outside. It meant Dorner could find her too. On the second day, SWAT extracted her and her son, rushing them — both hidden under hooded jackets — into an unmarked van.

Now, with cops stationed in the hall outside, she and her son had adjoining rooms in a hotel with a view from a high floor. She had packed his Xbox, a MacBook, an iPad and some underwear.

Hour after hour, Evans played video soccer with her son. She let him watch a little TV, so he understood the outlines of the situation, but tried to shield him from the details.

SWAT brought her lattes and turkey sandwiches. She picked at the meat. She threw up when she tried to eat. She was 115 pounds and shedding weight by the day.

She did not think Dorner could still be on the mountain. Someone must be helping him elude the dragnet, she thought. What if he was never caught?

Hundreds of tips poured in, most of them useless. 

She would have to quit the police work she loved. She would have to leave the country with her son. She would have to find a new home, maybe in Ireland, with relatives.

She told no one where she was, not even her ex-husband. She refused to stray outside the hotel room into the hall. Someone might notice her and snap a photograph and post it online. As quickly as that, the location of the safe house would be exposed.

She traded texts with her lawyer and friend, Robert Rico, who was also under heavy guard. Considering Dorner’s record, Rico thought, the real question wasn’t why the LAPD had fired him but why he hadn’t been fired sooner.

Evans and Rico kept returning to a disturbing realization: Sooner or later, their protection details would be pulled. “At some point,” Evans would say, “they’re going to dump me out the door and say, ‘Good luck to you.’ ”



Hundreds of tips poured in, most of them useless. One night, police stationed snipers at windows around an apartment building in a rundown San Bernardino neighborhood after a 911 caller claimed Dorner was inside with a stash of guns. It was a fake call, but some wary police still wondered: Was Dorner staging a diversion? Was he watching?

On Sunday, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa stood with Beck and Diaz, the Riverside police chief, to announce a $1-million reward for Dorner’s capture.

“We will not tolerate this reign of terror,” the mayor said.

By the next day, nearly a thousand bad tips had poured in. There were false Dorner sightings from Denver to Chicago.

They found nothing Sunday. They found nothing Monday.

Then it was Tuesday, and as the manhunt entered its seventh day, the Riverside Police Department was nervously preparing to bury Officer Michael Crain.

Dorner was not their only worry. He might have an acolyte, with a gun and a plan.

The memorial service at Grove Community Church, and the burial at nearby Riverside National Cemetery, were expected to draw 8,000 to 10,000 people, many of them cops.

It had been five days since anyone had seen Dorner. “You got a guy who has all kinds of high-powered weapons and a desire to kill,” recalled Riverside Police Department Deputy Chief Jeffrey Greer, who was organizing the service. “I am sweating bullets.”

If Dorner planted himself in the low-lying mountain range overlooking the church, he would have a direct line of sight in a sniper scope. Police tried to calculate if rounds from a .50-caliber rifle might reach mourners from that distance. They sent helicopters into the hills, looking for heat signatures.

They staked out high positions on buildings along the seven-mile stretch the caravan would travel from the church to the cemetery. There were 200 cops lined up to work security, and agencies from everywhere were volunteering manpower.

Dorner was not their only worry. He might have an acolyte, with a gun and a plan.
 

Big Bear Lake
 



On the mountain, search teams were being pulled out.

Dorner might be dead somewhere under the snow, and wouldn’t be found until the snow melted in weeks or months. But if he was still up there, the large crowds attending the upcoming Presidents’ Day weekend — combined with the lighter police presence — would give him a chance to slip away.

Just down the road from the spot where Dorner had abandoned his truck, Jim and Karen Reynolds were cleaning the 13-unit resort they managed in their retirement.

Around noon, they approached Room 203. Jim inserted the key.

Chapter Five: The Mountain

Flushed from hiding, a fugitive makes his stand

By Christopher Goffard, Louis Sahagun, Kurt Streeter and Phil Willon

Illustrations by Doug Stevens

December 15, 2013


Amid gunfire, a SWAT team mounts a rescue attempt for downed deputies. Christopher Dorner’s twisted quest ends in flames. 

 

San Bernardino
 



Everyone hunting him understood the equation. If Christopher Dorner was still alive, he would get the first shot.

Jeremiah MacKay was 35, a large, boisterous, red-haired detective on the major crimes squad of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. He had a wife, an infant son and a 6-year-old stepdaughter. It was hard to find a room in which he was not the loudest man.

MacKay had been searching Big Bear for days. He had grown up nearby, and knew the mountains well.

A fireman’s son with Irish roots, he liked pints of Guinness, expensive Scotch and wearing a kilt on St. Patrick’s Day. He played the bagpipes in the honor guard at police funerals. In his nearly 15 years on the job, he had seen more cop widows and cop orphans and grieving cop parents than almost anyone.

Out of uniform, he preferred not to mention his job, so people would be themselves. He introduced himself as a salesman for a fictional pickle company, with a dirty pun in the title. “They sell them at Trader Joe’s,” he would say. “A gourmet brand.”

As he hunted for Dorner that week, he received a call from a buddy on the force.

“Whoever finds him is gonna get killed, because he gets to act first,” the friend said. “Whoever opens that door...”

“I’m gonna get him,” MacKay said. “He’s a cop killer.”
 

Big Bear Lake
 



Jim and Karen Reynolds were about to find Christopher Dorner.

The couple, married 36 years, lived above the office of the Mountain Vista Resort on Club View Drive, which they ran with their grown daughter.

Jim was 66, a former Navy man and IBM system engineer, tall, lanky, and white-haired, with wild, bushy eyebrows. Karen was 56, a former nurse, small, sweet-faced and bespectacled.

Their resort was a cluster of 1980s-era brown condo units, with maple trees and a towering Ponderosa pine. They were going room to room, stripping sheets and collecting towels, when they came to Room 203.

Five days before, when Dorner’s pickup was discovered up the road, Jim had methodically checked the doors and found this cabin locked. It had been unlocked earlier for repairs, he knew, but he assumed one of his family members had re-locked it.

Now, Jim opened the door and they entered, climbing the red-carpeted stairway. It led upstairs to a living room with an old stone fireplace, a kitchenette and a sliding-glass door that opened onto a snow-covered balcony.

Jim went to the window to examine the curtain rod, which needed repairs. Karen was heading toward the hallway that led to a bedroom, looking for fresh linens.

Dorner emerged from the hallway, pointing a handgun.

Karen recognized him at once. She yelled and ran back down the stairs toward the entrance. She had the door open. She was partway through. She hesitated.

She couldn’t leave her husband. She couldn’t risk leading Dorner to her daughter, who was somewhere on the property. She thought of her own life: If you go out that door, he has to shoot you.

In a moment Dorner was on her, digging his fingers into her forearm.

Upstairs, Jim fumbled for the smartphone in the rubber case on his waist, but couldn’t get it free in time to dial 911. He hid it in the sofa cushions.

Dorner came back up the stairs with Karen and said, “I know you know who I am.”
 
 For the first time, Karen understood the literal truth of the concept of being paralyzed with fear.

Jim thought they were as good as dead. It was an hour’s drive, at least, to get off the mountain. His only chance of escape was to kill them.

By appearances, Dorner had been there for days. There were trail mix wrappers and containers for ready-to-eat meals. There were footprints on the snow-covered balcony. He had used a towel in the downstairs shower.

Jim thought Dorner looked well-rested, with a couple days’ growth of beard, and composed like a man trained to handle tense situations.

After abandoning his truck, Dorner would have had to walk only a short distance to reach Club View Drive. From there, at a brisk pace, past log cabins and gracious A-frames and porches adorned with antlers and carved wooden bears, he would have made it to their resort in five minutes.

The San Bernardino County sheriff would insist that searchers had checked it, but had found no signs of forced entry, and were not authorized to kick down the door. The Reynoldses said deputies never contacted them to ask permission to go inside.

However it happened, Dorner’s presence had been missed. From the room’s porch window, he could have seen his truck towed into the parking lot of the ski resort across the street.

He could have seen police helicopters landing and taking off, and an army of law enforcement – police, sheriff’s deputies and federal agents – coming and going from the command post. Along with fleets of reporters and cameramen, they would have passed easily within range of his sniper scope.

Because the room had an Internet hookup and cable, he could have watched the manhunt unfold live, and learned that the massive effort was dwindling.

“I just want to clear my name,” Dorner told the Reynoldses.

The couple was shaking with fear. Dorner explained that he had spared the San Diego yacht owner, and would spare them too. They were merely means to an end.

Jim thought of mentioning that he had been a Navy man himself. Maybe this would endear him to Dorner, and increase the odds of survival. Then he remembered hearing that Dorner’s stint with the Navy had ended badly.

Jim thought fleetingly of throwing himself on Dorner, maybe distracting him just long enough for his wife to escape. But he doubted she would leave him anyway. And trying to overpower a bigger, younger, stronger man seemed a fool’s errand.

“Do you have a car?” Dorner demanded.

Yes, they said, it was parked in front of the office with a full tank of gas. A purple-maroon Nissan Rogue. He took the key.

Dorner ordered them to kneel on the sofa with their faces against the wall, their ankles crossed and their hands up.

Dorner said he had seen Jim shoveling snow a few days earlier.

“You are good, hard-working people,” he said.

They felt Dorner tightening zip-ties around their wrists. Dorner took Karen’s cellphone out of her jacket pocket. He ordered them to their feet, and told them to go down the hallway toward the bedroom.


Watch: Big Bear couple held captive 

 


“Calm down, I’m not going to kill you, let’s go back upstairs.”

— Karen Reynolds, recounting what Christopher Dorner said to her

Get Flash Player

“Don’t look around,” he said. “Look at the ceiling.”

In the bedroom, atop a small dresser, Jim noticed pieces of carrots and a dull-bladed butcher knife from the kitchen. He is going to hack us to death back here, he thought.

Dorner ordered them to lie face-down on the floor, then tightened zip-ties around their feet. Searching Jim’s pockets, Dorner found a Hershey bar and asked if he was a diabetic.

“Yes,” he said.

“Oh s---,” Dorner said.

He put the chocolate between them on the carpet.

He left the room and returned with washcloths to stuff in their mouths. He pulled pillowcases over their heads. He found electrical cords and tied them around their heads, to hold the gags in place. He jerked their heads back.

“Say the alphabet,” Dorner ordered her.

“A...B...C...D...E...F...G...H...I...J...K...” She slurred and mumbled more than necessary, to convey the impression the gag could be no tighter, and Dorner seemed satisfied when she reached “K.”

He pushed them face-down on the carpet. They could hear him packing a bag. He asked calmly if they would be quiet long enough for him to escape.

For the first time, Karen understood the literal truth of the concept of being paralyzed with fear. But she managed to nod.
 

They heard his footsteps in the hallway. They listened for the thump of the front door closing. Instead, they heard Dorner’s voice, now tinged with panic: “These aren’t car keys!”

It was a keyless car, they explained through their gags. Just push the starter.

Dorner disappeared again.

Karen was terrified that he would run into her daughter, who was on the property, maybe in the laundry room just below. She felt her hands and feet swelling from the zip-ties. She maneuvered her head down to Jim’s hands. His fingers fumbled uselessly as he tried to get the pillowcase off her face.

She scooted and wriggled until her hands were at Jim’s head, and her fingers found purchase and removed his pillowcase. Then he was able to pull off hers.

She rocked back and forth, struggling to her knees and then her feet. She saw the butcher knife on the dresser and got its handle in her teeth. Maybe the edge would cut the zip-ties.

She dialed 911. She got an operator. Dorner is in Big Bear, she said.

She dropped the knife toward Jim, hoping he could grab it. She heard a noise through the door. She kicked the knife against the wall, where it would be hidden behind the door if Dorner returned.

They waited. Dorner did not return. She pushed down on the door handle and hopped into the hallway and into the living room. With her hands still tied behind her back, she grabbed the land-line and tried to dial 911 but couldn’t manage it.

She noticed that Dorner had inexplicably left her smartphone on the coffee table. It was a new phone, and it took awhile to find the speaker-phone button.

She dialed 911. She got an operator. Dorner is in Big Bear, she said. He has our car. It was 12:23 p.m. He had a head start of 15 to 30 minutes.



Det. Alex Collins had spent the morning searching the woods near the condo, trying to rethink his assumptions about where the fugitive might be. He and his partner were back at the Big Bear station, about to head to lunch, when the radios crackled: Dorner was near Big Bear. He was driving a stolen purple Nissan Rogue.

Collins and his partner grabbed their tactical vests and rifles and jumped into the truck. On his iPhone, Collins Googled “Nissan Rogue” so he could be sure what it looked like.

There were only a few ways off the mountain, and they reasoned that Dorner would not risk California Highway 18, which would take him through town.

They guessed he would try to sneak out the back way, on California Highway 38, toward Redlands.
 

Yucaipa, Calif.
 



Deputy Jeremiah MacKay was at his office at the Yucaipa station when he got the word. That morning, detectives had visited his office to seek his help on a drug-related homicide, but the talk had quickly turned to Dorner.

The men knew the mountain, and batted around ideas about where he could be. It seemed outrageous that one man could hold law enforcement hostage like this.

MacKay said what he had been saying all week: “I want to get him.”

He raced up the mountain.
 

San Bernardino National Forest
 



On Highway 38, near Glass Road, four law enforcement officers — two San Bernardino County deputies and two state Fish and Wildlife wardens — were setting up a checkpoint and laying spike strips.

They noticed a pair of school buses coming down the narrow, winding highway, headed west. The Nissan Rogue was following close behind, as if to guard against the spike strips. Dorner was at the wheel.

The officers jumped into their cars and gave chase. Dorner swerved around the buses and accelerated. In the time it took the pursuing cars to get around the buses, Dorner had vanished.

They guessed that he had hooked a hard right on Glass Road, which twisted downhill through thick, snow-covered forest toward the community of Seven Oaks.

They raced down, rifles out the window. About a mile down the road, they found the Rogue smashed against a snowbank, the windshield cracked, the air bags deployed. Inside, Dorner had abandoned a package of Quickclot, meant to pour on wounds, and a small arsenal: smoke grenades, tear-gas canisters and a silencer-equipped Remington sniper rifle bearing the word VENGEANCE.

Nearby, on the same road, a 62-year-old man who ran a local Boy Scout camp was driving by in his silver Dodge Ram when Dorner walked out of the trees aiming his assault rifle. The driver parked and raised his hands.

“I don’t want to hurt you,” Dorner said. “Just get out.”

Three wardens, stationed down the hill at Seven Oaks, were now racing up Glass Road in two separate trucks, lights flashing and sirens blaring.

They were looking for the purple Nissan, not the stolen Dodge pickup in which Dorner was now hurtling toward them.

Dorner crossed paths with the first warden, who noticed Dorner behind the wheel and radioed a warning to the second truck.

Dorner raised his AR-15 and fired at the second truck, a four-door Chevrolet pickup. Inside were two wardens and a German shepherd, Reno. Bullets struck the windshield. The roof. The driver’s window. The door jamb. Glass shattered on the wardens.

They knew a rule from the academy: Drive through an ambush, then get back into the fight.

One of the wardens, Ben Matias, an ex-Marine, jumped out of the truck, ran to a berm and spotted Dorner taking sharp turns down the hill. He took aim with his .308 assault rifle and emptied a 20-round magazine at the fleeing truck. It disappeared.



Det. Alex Collins, racing to the scene, received calls in quick succession from both his older brothers. Like him, they were San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies hunting for Dorner. They told him the same thing: Be careful. Don’t rush in alone. Wait for us.

With his partner driving, Collins was scanning the woods around Glass Road over the top of his Mini-14 semiautomatic rifle, forest rushing by on both sides. They passed the Fish and Wildlife truck with the blown-out driver’s side window.

They hung a left at the bottom of Glass Road. On the right, at 40700 Seven Oaks Road, stood an empty one-story wood cabin. A stone fireplace rose above its east side. It sat amid a towering forest of white oaks, black oaks and cedar pines.

He’d been running scenarios through his head all week, preparing himself. What if he found Dorner on the road? In a car? In a closet?

Trucks of law officers hurtled past the cabin. Collins and his partner stopped just west of it and climbed out.

They were looking for the stolen truck. Where they found it, they knew, they would find Dorner. But there was no sign of it anywhere around the cabin.

They did not know that Dorner had sent it to the bottom of an embankment behind the cabin.

They did not know that he was now inside the cabin, waiting for a target.

Collins was side-stepping along the road, head tilted over his aimed rifle, when he saw a flash. He had the sensation of being punched in the face. A round from Dorner’s assault rifle entered just under his left nostril, crashed through the roof of his mouth, shattered his front teeth, split his tongue and exploded bone as it emerged from his lower right jaw. His face went numb.

The bullets seemed to be coming from a cabin window, but the muffled pop pop pop from Dorner’s silencer made it hard to pinpoint where. Another round struck Collins just below the left kneecap. A round passed through his left forearm. A round struck his chest.

He scrambled behind the back wheel of another cop’s silver Dodge Durango and collapsed. Bullets were flying all around him. Rounds sailed through the truck. Shattered glass from the Dodge fell at his feet.

Dorner seemed to be shooting carefully, whenever he saw an exposed human shape. He was firing at the pavement under the truck, trying to kill with ricochets.

Collins thought: “In seconds, I’ll pass out and die.”

He was choking on his blood and teeth. He was sure the burning in his chest was a high-powered AR-15 round that had pierced his ballistic vest.

He thought: “It wasn’t supposed to happen like this.”

He’d been running scenarios through his head all week, preparing himself. What if he found Dorner on the road? In a car? In a closet? He’d tried to imagine how he would react. And now he was close to death with no idea how it had happened.

Trim and athletic, he ran three miles a day, and he knew how to push through pain. But the pain in his leg was excruciating, and he thought: “If I am going to die, God, let me go now.”

He felt he had let everybody down. He thought of how furious his brothers would be at him.

He had to call his wife. He would spend his last seconds telling her he loved her, and explaining that he wouldn’t be home tonight, that he was sorry he let this happen, sorry for leaving her alone with a brand-new baby.

He reached under his ballistic vest. He kept his iPhone in a jacket pocket over his heart. The phone was shattered. Angrily, he hurled it away.

Seconds passed, and he realized he wasn’t dead yet. He heard yelling and gunfire.

He thought: “Don’t panic. Don’t freak out.”

Collins watched his own blood pooling on the pavement. Then something happened that he did not understand.

He thought of his training at the Sheriff’s Academy, where cops who had been shot spoke of the Will to Live, of never giving up. He thought of the Navy SEAL in one of his favorite books, “Lone Survivor,” who had survived horrific injury in Afghanistan.

He leaned forward on his arm, to allow the blood filling up his throat to pour onto the pavement.

A few feet away, Deputy Jeremiah MacKay had scrambled behind another wheel of the Dodge and was firing at the cabin. A rescue chopper was overhead, and MacKay got on the radio to tell the pilot which structure Dorner was firing from.

“It’s gonna be right from where you’re at now,” MacKay said, his words captured on a dispatch recording. “Right ahead of you — right ahead of you — directly underneath you right now —”

Seconds later, as he tried to direct the helicopter, MacKay lost just enough of his cover to give Dorner a target.

The bullet went in at a high angle, right above MacKay’s ballistic shield, and ricocheted into his chest. He was dead almost instantly.

A few feet away, Collins watched his own blood pooling on the pavement. Then something happened that he did not understand. He turned his head and saw that he was completely exposed to the cabin. The Dodge Durango that had been shielding him had vanished. He saw his rifle in the road, but couldn’t reach it. He waited for a bullet to hit his head.

A hasty rescue attempt had cost him his cover. One cop had intended to drag the shot deputies out of the line of fire, using the Dodge — driven by a second cop — as a moving shield. Amid the fear and pandemonium and flying bullets, the truck was driven off, and the downed deputies left in the road.


They called it the kill zone, a wide-open stretch of road in the direct line of Dorner’s assault rifle, and now Collins and MacKay lay in the middle of it. For perhaps 20 or 30 yards, there were no cars, no trees, no sources of cover at all.

“Shots fired. Officer down....”

“Automatic fire coming in-bound....”

“Officers still down in the kill zone....”

San Bernardino County Sheriff’s SWAT Sgt. John Charbonneau raced up in his truck. In the seat beside him was Det. Justin Musella, who had fought as an Army Ranger in Afghanistan, and who now recognized the faint THWUP THWUP THWUP of silenced high-powered rounds flying from the cabin.

“Sergeant, stop! We’re getting shot at!”

They jumped out and opened fire at the cabin. More cops arrived, and raced to find cover behind trucks and trees. Glass fragments flew outward from the cabin as Dorner fired. There was the rustle of a curtain in one of the cabin’s east windows.

Officers poured in rounds. Dorner’s bullets zipped overhead. They thwacked into trees and pierced the sides of cars. The smell of gunpowder saturated the thin, cold air.

The two downed deputies still lay motionless in the road, and for the men who could see them every second was excruciating. Instinct told them to race out and retrieve their brothers; logic told them this would guarantee their own quick death.

They needed an armored vehicle to provide cover for the rescue, but nobody could say how long it would take to get it there.

Musella sprinted closer toward the cabin, taking cover behind a small, wooden, free-standing game room across the driveway. He tossed a smoke grenade toward Dorner, but it landed in the snow. The smoke churned upward; the wind blew it back toward the officers.

He threw another. This time, the smoke rose and created a wall between the cabin and the downed deputies.

On the west side, SWAT deputies Daniel Rosa and Larry Lopez locked eyes. This was their chance.

Lopez ran into the road first, as officers laid down a barrage of cover fire. He grabbed the first deputy he came to, MacKay, a big man, and dragged him 25 to 50 yards until they were behind a shield of trucks. Breathing hard, he grabbed his rifle and looked at Rosa.

“Your turn,” he said.

Rosa sprinted out to Collins. He grabbed his vest and started dragging.



Tell my brothers I love them, Collins was saying. Tell them I’m sorry I screwed up.

He felt himself being loaded into the back of someone’s pickup truck, and then a blaze of pain as MacKay’s body was loaded on board partly on top of his wounded leg. He saw himself bleeding into a pair of spare boots. He thought: Someone will be mad.

The high-powered round had pierced his ballistic shield and been deflected by the iPhone in his jacket pocket.

He was aware of a gurney beneath him, of men carrying him into a rescue chopper.

Put me on my stomach, he managed to say, or I will choke on my blood.

On the way to Loma Linda Hospital, he clutched his cloth sheriff’s badge in his fist. He did not know why. He was still conscious when the emergency room staff cut off his clothes and boots.

Doctors examined his chest. The high-powered round had pierced his ballistic shield and been deflected by the iPhone in his jacket pocket. It had saved his life.



Around the cabin, after perhaps 10 minutes of furious gunfire, everything slowed down. There were 30 or 40 officers with assault rifles forming a perimeter to ensure that Dorner wouldn’t escape. They passed around fresh ammunition magazines.

A dozen cops were trapped, hunkered behind a row of trucks in front of the cabin. When an armored personnel carrier finally reached them, 45 minutes after the shooting had started, they scrambled inside and got away.

Deputies received word, from the cabin owner, that the property was not occupied, dispelling worries that Dorner might have a hostage. They learned the cabin had a basement.

Was the LAPD so zealous because Dorner had been one of their own? Did they doubt their San Bernardino counterparts could handle the crisis?

A team of LAPD SWAT officers had taken command of a fire helicopter and flown to the mountain. They were deposited on a ridge about a half-mile north of the cabin.

“I’m not sure if they were invited or not, or if anyone’s controlling them,” a sheriff’s deputy said over the radio.

Not only had the helicopter presented another target for Dorner’s rifle, but the local deputies lacked direct radio contact with the LAPD team, which created the possibility of confusion and chaos.

Was the LAPD so zealous because Dorner had been one of their own? Did they doubt their San Bernardino counterparts could handle the crisis? A “miscommunication,” the LAPD called it, a result of bad cellphone and radio coverage in the mountains.

Whatever the reason, San Bernardino County sheriff’s commanders were furious. They ordered the LAPD team not to get any closer.



From the SWAT truck, an amplified voice boomed an order to surrender: You are surrounded. You have no chance of escape.

No response.

They fired canisters of tear gas into the cabin. Still no sign of Dorner.

At 3:45 p.m. a sheriff’s deputy rumbled toward the cabin in an armored tractor and tore into the east wall with an extendable claw. The claw ripped out a door and some windows. A camera mounted on the tractor appeared to show a wall covered in blood.

Police later surmised this was not blood but the orange-red burst of pepper spray from a gas canister.

At 4:05 p.m., greenish smoke emerged from the cabin. Dorner had popped his own smoke canister, apparently expecting that the SWAT team would be rushing into the house. The smoke would blind them, and give him an advantage.

This meant Dorner was alive. Nobody rushed in.

SWAT command decided to shoot in canisters of CS gas, called burners. Also known as hot gas, or pyrotechnic tear gas, it had a propensity to spark fires.
 
 At 4:20 p.m., from the cabin, there came the sound of a single gunshot. 

Share this excerpt

Critics would question this decision. Why not just wait Dorner out?

Dorner had shown no willingness to surrender. He had not attempted to communicate with deputies. He was well-armed, and possibly equipped with rations, meaning the standoff could go on indefinitely. His manifesto made it clear he planned to die.

The shadows of the tall pines were lengthening. Every minute represented further risk to the law officers, risk that would multiply when darkness overtook the snowbound mountains. Dorner might possess night-vision goggles that would enable him to find targets.

On their radios, deputies orchestrated the end-game.

“We’re going to go forward with the plan, with the burner....”

Hot gas went in at 4:09 p.m. Flames began to spread. They waited for Dorner; he did not emerge.

“Seven burners deployed, and we have a fire.”

“We have a fire in the front and he might come out the back....”

At 4:20 p.m., from the cabin, there came the sound of a single gunshot.

“No. 4 side fully engulfed....”

A firetruck was told to hang back a couple hundred yards. Ignited by fire, ammunition was exploding inside the cabin.

“This thing’s well-constructed.... I still have ammo popping here....”

“Fully engulfed....”

“More ammo going off....”

“I’m told that there’s basement in that cabin.... I’m going to let that heat burn through that basement.”

“Good call....”

The fire wasn’t spreading to nearby homes or trees. They let it burn.



Live on television, people watched the climax of the Dorner manhunt play out in flames.

At Dorner’s favorite watering hole in Las Vegas, bartenders and customers watched.

At the manhunt command post in Norwalk, an army of cops watched.

At LAPD headquarters, the chief stood with the mayor and watched.
 
 “We got him,” one of them said. “It’s OK. We got him.” 

Share this excerpt

At a secret hotel room, Dorner’s former training officer, Teresa Evans, watched.

At Grove Community Church in Riverside, where a viewing was underway for Michael Crain, people had been trying to shield his widow Regina from the news, because it had not been confirmed that it was Dorner in the cabin.

But Regina kept asking where her husband’s friends on the SWAT team were, and finally someone told her they were on the mountain.

At 8 p.m. they still had not shown up, and she pleaded with the church to keep the viewing open a little longer. A few minutes later the SWAT team entered, their faces smeared with camouflage paint.

They took turns hugging her.

“We got him,” one of them said. “It’s OK. We got him.”



Michael Crain’s 10-year-old son walked slowly behind his father’s flag-draped casket the next day. He looked tiny among the police pallbearers, his palms pressed against one end of the casket.

A woman from the neighborhood watched the long caravan of police cars pass by, lights flashing. She told her twin granddaughters: “Put your hands over your hearts.”

Regina Crain received the folded American flag from the police chief, and watched as her husband was buried.

Later, she would ask commanders for the badge her husband had worn the night of his death, so she could put it in a place of honor. They were reluctant, and she knew why: a bullet from Dorner’s AR-15 had torn through her husband’s badge, and the shield, on the way to his heart.



Teresa Evans still did not feel safe.

Maybe the dead man in the cabin was a Dorner look-alike, an accomplice. It did not seem crazier than what had already happened.

“What seemed impossible before is no longer impossible,” she said. “My reality is, I’m not really sure what could happen at any time.”

Back home alone, she coped with her nerves by cleaning. She took down the sheets over the windows. She put the furniture back in place. She couldn’t eat.

Even after experts confirmed that the charred body in the basement was Dorner — first by dental records, then by comparing a sample of Dorner’s DNA kept by the Navy to marrow from the femur of the charred corpse — she remained apprehensive. What if someone tried to finish what he started?

“  What seemed impossible before is no longer impossible.” 
— LAPD Sgt. Teresa Evans

One day, she found that someone had removed her window screen and tried to get inside her house.

Another day, she saw graffiti on a wall near the police station: TERRI EVANS IS A LIAR. On the Web, some people hailed Dorner as a hero and said she deserved whatever she got.

She thought about changing her name, but it would be easy to find the new one in public records. She knew her name would be visible, on her uniform, as long as she wore one.

Not long ago, she drove up the mountain and stared at the blackened hole in the ground where Dorner had died. She badly wanted to talk to the families he had hurt. But she dreaded what they might think. What if they held her responsible for pushing him over the edge?

“I don’t know how people feel about me,” she said. “I don’t know who blames me, and who doesn’t.”

So far, she hasn’t returned to work. Even at the LAPD, she can’t be sure who is her friend.



By his charred corpse, police found the 9-millimeter Glock that Dorner had used to put a single bullet through his temple.

Ballistics analysis matched the gun to the shootings of Keith Lawrence and Monica Quan. The charred AR-15 assault rifle found in the basement was matched to the slayings of Michael Crain and Jeremiah MacKay, and the shootings of Alex Collins and Andrew Tachias.

In Dorner’s wallet, along with a fake police badge, an LAPD business card had survived the cabin fire. On it, he had written the names of two of the police captains who oversaw his Board of Rights. Their addresses were included, and the names of their wives.



For the LAPD’s mistaken shooting of Emma Hernandez and her daughter, Margie Carranza, the newspaper delivery women received a $4-million settlement from the city.

Of the two, Carranza is the more traumatized. She is afraid of police, and afraid to go out at night. When she takes her children to the movies, she sits separately from them.

Her logic is simple. If someone comes with a gun to kill her, she does not want her children to die too.



Alex Collins spent two months in the hospital, an armed deputy standing guard day and night. A conference room was outfitted with a recliner and a baby crib, so Collins’ wife and infant son could stay close.

His wife wondered what would have happened if he had worn his smartphone in his back pocket that day, instead of over his chest. One day, in his hospital room, he and his wife caught a glimpse of the television news. A man was getting Christopher Dorner’s face tattooed on his arm.

Collins underwent 20 surgeries. The roof of his mouth was repaired, his tongue sewn together, his obliterated teeth replaced, his shattered leg embedded with pins. Plastic surgeons erased the mark of the bullet hole under his nose. He learned to stand with a walker, and finally to do without the walker, and now his limp is barely visible.

He returned to police work in September, in the intelligence division. His son will turn 1 in January.



Riverside Police Officer Andrew Tachias lives in constant pain from Dorner’s bullets. He has no movement in his left arm, and little in his right. He has grown reclusive, and has trouble talking about the shooting that took his partner’s life. “He hasn’t healed at all,” his father says.

The cabdriver who helped save Tachias’ life insists he did nothing extraordinary.

“If you are at same place and same time, I believe you are gonna do the same,” says Karam Kaoud, then thinks about it some more and says, “Actually, I don’t know.”

He still drives a cab, only now he hates to be stopped at red lights. He doesn’t want to be a target.



“I don’t defend what Dorner did, but like many in the community, I believe what he said,” a man told Charlie Beck.

The LAPD chief was standing before a crowd in South Los Angeles. The speaker’s sentiment was no surprise. For those who remembered similar community meetings from 20 years ago, what seemed remarkable was the softer tone. No one shouted at the chief; no one cursed him.

“We hire from the human race and we hire the best people we can, and sometimes they make mistakes,” Beck said.

Recently, the LAPD completed its review of Christopher Dorner’s firing. The conclusion was the same. He had told a lie about his training officer, and his badge had been properly stripped.



Randal Quan drove to the Irvine Police Department to meet the chief detective who had worked his daughter’s killing.

He was there not to discuss the case, but because he had requested the jewelry his daughter had been wearing when she was killed. He wanted to bury her in it.

Usually, the transfer of such property took time. There was red tape.

Det. Victoria Hurtado wanted to ensure he received it without delay. She walked to the property room. She removed Monica Quan’s engagement ring, necklace, bracelets and watch from the sealed evidence bags.

The jewelry was caked with blood.

She found a brush and paper towels, and went to the sink. She began cleaning.

Ever since he died, 10 years ago today, people have been clamoring to tell Elliott Smith's story for him: writers, poets, fellow musicians, his religiously devoted fans—anyone who felt the subliminal undertow of his songs. The urge is understandable. Smith’s music, with its forensic attention to mood, dredges some of our murkiest emotions to the surface and coaxes unnameable sensations into focus. When an artist has this gift, they stir powerful needs.

Since the moment Smith began making solo recordings, beginning with the whispered, hyper-intimate 1994 collection Roman Candle, he has inspired fervent reactions. His story is dotted with followers, people who instinctively grasped the appeal of his music and felt themselves helplessly conscripted to his cause. They became storytellers for Elliott’s genius and originality, champions for someone allergic to championing himself.

What follows is not an oral history of his life, but of his music; specifically, his solo career. The lines between life and music are tangled, of course, in ways that aren’t neatly prizable, and darker stories eventually creep into the frame at the edges. But the arc traced here begins with the emergence of That Voice: the flowering of his talent, the development of the intimate, inscrutable folk-pop he would mine for the rest of his career. That discovery dovetails with the dissolution of his first band, the loud-rocking Heatmiser. In some ways the development of the former triggered the latter. The story told here begins at this hinge point, as Smith begins exploring the possibilities of his fiercely intimate four-track solo recordings that would pull him away from Heatmiser and, eventually, into the national spotlight.

For those who knew him personally, the task of speaking for Elliott Smith wavers between privilege and burden. Many of the 18 people who spoke to me—bandmates, producers, managers, friends—emerged hesitantly, stepping gingerly over their own profound misgivings, issuing grave caveats. They’d been burned before, they warned me. They swore they’d never speak again. The story of their self-imposed silence, and their individual choices to break it or hold it, runs in powerful counterpoint to Smith’s own story. Some of the singer's closest associates have simply declined to go on record: Having been prodded multiple times, they have understandably snapped shut. Some are speaking now for the first time. The combination of profound ambivalence and fierce conviction in their voices, as they opened themselves up, was chastening.

Heatmiser

In 1984, Elliott Smith—born Steven Paul Smith—moves to Portland from Duncanville, Texas, to live with his father, Gary Smith, and Gary’s wife Marta Greenwald. There, at Lincoln High School, he meets Tony Lash, future drummer of Heatmiser, and forms his first band, Stranger Than Fiction. Upon graduating, he goes off to Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he meets Neil Gust and forms an early version of Heatmiser. (It is around this time that Steven Paul Smith begins going by “Elliott.”) When he returns to Portland after graduation, Gust, Smith, Lash, and bassist Brandt Peterson form the final version of that band. 


TONY LASH [high school friend; drummer, Heatmiser]: In the high school band, I played flute and Elliott played clarinet. He was funny, and we were both kind of nerdy. A friend of mine introduced us because we both liked Rush.

Elliott's songs were ridiculously complicated then. He had so many ideas and he hadn't really developed his arrangement skills, so the songs would start in one place and go through all these sections and then end arbitrarily. But having come from a prog background, it wasn't hard for me to negotiate all the time changes. We recorded our one really ambitious album when I was a senior and he was a junior; we definitely aimed high, even if the results weren't necessarily stellar. 

We kept in touch while he was at Hampshire College; I stayed in Portland and went into record production, getting a job at a studio. Every summer we worked on some kind of a project. Then Elliott came back from college and we started playing together again as Heatmiser.

JJ GONSON [manager, Heatmiser; girlfriend]: The first time I saw Heatmiser was in 1993, at X-Ray in Portland. I had this visceral response, which I've only had with a few bands. I was impressed by every single member. Elliott was clearly an uber-talented songwriter, Neil [Gust] was clearly an almost-as-talented songwriter, and they both had terrific singing voices and were really gifted guitar players. The drummer [Tony Lash] was excellent. There was not a slacker in Heatmiser. 

Neil and Elliott had very different guitar skills that complemented each other beautifully. In fact, when I met them, I would say that Neil was the more accomplished of the two. But Elliott had a natural aptitude that was unique. He could hear music and make it come out of his fingers in a way that most guitar players can't. He never stumbled. It was like there was a channel that went straight from his brain to his fingers, and that was immediately evident watching him play live. You only see that kind of skill level once in a while, so when you see it, you know it. 

TONY LASH: I have a lot of fond memories of that time. Portland still has an extremely vibrant music scene, but there was a bit more of a united, focused community with the bands and the people that came to see music then. La Luna, along with a few other places, was the epicenter of that, the place where the large shows happened. We definitely packed our shows, and people were really into it.

.


JJ GONSON: A phenomenal thing happened in Portland in the early 90s. At La Luna, someone had this idea to charge one dollar at the door to see three local bands every Monday night. The club capacity was maybe 1,000, and they got to keep the bar, but the bands could sell merchandise and they got 100% of the door. So every Monday night the bands were pretty much guaranteed at least $300—which was huge in 1993—and the shows had Heatmiser, Crackerbash, Pond, Hazel, the Dandy Warhols. It was all local. It sold out every Monday, because nobody had a job, really—this was the early 90s and there was no work. The bands would get their cash and, more importantly, they would have the experience of playing in front of 1,000 people who knew their songs. What you ended up with is these bands that perform really well. 

Heatmiser were just a phenomenal, rip-your-head-off-and-shove-it-up-your-ass rock band. I saw them hundreds of times. Elliott was so into it; in every photo I took of them onstage from that time, he's biting his lip. The thing I remember most vividly is that he always had this exact same rocking motion in his body language.

[Both Neil and Elliott] were writing really good songs, but I immediately recognized that Elliott was writing in a way that maybe… appealed to me more personally? When they did that Yellow No. 5 EP, the song "Idler" might have been around when I started to go “whoa, whoa, whoa.” That really quiet, haunting thing. Also, at that point I was already hearing some of Roman Candle. It's just that I wasn't hearing it in the same way. I was hearing it at home.







Roman Candle (1994)

In 1993, Smith moves in with JJ Gonson, at a house on Southeast 29th Avenue and Taylor Street in Portland. In the basement, he begins rehearsing and recording the music that would become his first solo release, Roman Candle.


JJ GONSON: We were all kids, hanging out. There was a lot of Sonic the Hedgehog and sitting around. He and I had a very simpatico sense of humor and found a lot of similar interests in music; we'd just sit around and play together for hours and sing. 

For a long time we were “just good friends,” and I remember seeing him leaning against an ex-girlfriend one time and thinking, "Why is that bothering me? That shouldn't be bothering me.” I'd already worked with the band for awhile, and he wrote songs about feeling like he shouldn't be dating me, wanting to, and knowing that it wasn't the right thing to do. Neither of us would deal with it for a long time. And when we finally did, all of our friends were like, "No! That's a really bad idea!" [laughs] Was it a bad idea? I don't know. He was the love of my life in a lot of ways. I'm enormously grateful to have had that emotional experience. I think that everybody should be that in love with somebody, even if it has to come to an end.

At the Taylor Street house, he would sit upstairs playing for hours and hours and hours, working on the songs, and then he'd go downstairs for half an hour and put something down on tape. He didn't spend very much time in the "studio," which was the basement. It was gross down there; he was perched on a stool surrounded by garbage. It wasn't like it was a couch and cappuccinos. I don't even think we had a washing machine. He was welcome to be down there by himself, nobody wanted to be down there.

The whole sound quality of Roman Candle is entirely based on the fact that he's using a low-quality microphone right up against his fingers. He doesn't even have an acoustic pickup—he's playing an acoustic guitar into a microphone. 

I had a copy of the finished cassette on me all the time and I was listening to it all the time. I had a lot of friends at Sub Pop and Matador and Cavity Search and all these record labels, and I was hanging out with them because I was promoting [Heatmiser], and I needed these labels to put their bands on tour with my band, but I didn’t burst into Cavity Search Records like, "You have to play this! It's the best thing you've ever heard and you need to release it right now." I was probably just like, "I've got this solo cassette by Elliott." "What? Elliott does solo stuff?" I put it on and their jaws dropped. They released it without changing a thing. That's Roman Candle.

TONY LASH: We mixed Roman Candle in my basement—to the extent that you can mix off of a four-track cassette. It was so different from what Heatmiser was doing. I didn't have a sense right then that it was going to become his big thing. A lot more care was taken with recording his second solo record, but even then it seemed more like an extremely viable side project to me, with Heatmiser as the main focus. 

SLIM MOON [founder, Kill Rock Stars]: I didn't know Elliott at all, but we were both playing on this small tour of solo artists going down the West Coast. The first night was in Seattle, and I missed Elliott's set. The second night was at the Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco, and I was blown away by Elliott's set. So I went out to the car to listen to [Roman Candle] rather than staying for the rest of the show.

I was just flabbergasted. It was so incredibly good. And really, really different from anything anybody else was doing. It was soft and gritty at the same time—a really rare combination. The song that blew me away was "Last Call", it's in my top 10 favorite songs to this day. It's the perfect song in terms of lyrics, melody, as a piece of poetry: "You're a crisis/ You're an icicle/ You're a tongueless talker/ You don't care what you say/ You're a jaywalker and you just walk away." Those lines stick with me. 

There's this little trick that he does in that song where he drops the tuning at the end. It almost feels like it's two songs edited together, except he would play it live and reach over and just turn the tuning peg as he played. It's not a studio trick. It impressed me that it was all done on a four-track, too, because the cheaper the production is, the less you can hide your flaws. Like, Lars [Ulrich] of Metallica is one of the worst drummers I've ever heard, but they hide it because they spend millions recording. [laughs]

LARRY CRANE [owner, Jackpot! Recording Studio; producer/engineer; archivist for Smith's family]: I’m really supportive of the local music scene and everything, but I’m not always impressed by the quality of other people’s work. [laughs] But when I heard Roman Candle, I thought, "Wow, that’s pretty good for the guy from Heatmiser." Initially, I thought Heatmiser were another crummy, wild guitar band that the grunge era brought up. But I started realizing, “Oh wait, they have songs.”

MARGARET MITTLEMAN [manager]: Slim Moon fell in love with Elliott, and he told me I had to come down and see him. I don't remember what he played. I'm more of a vibe person, and Elliott's demeanor hit me right away, right in the stomach. He was just sitting in a chair in the corner, but he seemed so special in every way. 

We talked after that show. My intent was just to help him. He wasn’t interested in a publishing contract or a manager. I was working at BMG Publishing, and one of our goals at the time was to sign things really inexpensively and just offer services. Anyway, he liked us, and he liked that we had done work with Beck, who was a recent artist I had signed. We developed a friendship.







Elliott Smith (1995)

Smith records his self-titled record at friend Leslie Uppinghouse’s house, moving on from Cavity Search to Slim Moon’s Kill Rock Stars label. The album is released on July 25, 1995, accompanied by a larger promotional campaign. 


SLIM MOON: We talked about his ideas or hopes for the next step after Roman Candle, and he mentioned that he was interested in being on K Records. I knew [K owner] Calvin [Johnson], so over the next couple of months, I gave him a copy of the record, told him that Elliott was the real deal, and told him to come see him play. I never heard back from Calvin about that. To my knowledge, Elliott never heard from Calvin either. I talked to Elliott a while later and said, "Would it be cool if Kill Rock Stars put out a 7"?"

We never did multi-record deals at Kill Rock Stars back then. We would just do one album, see how it went, and then discuss it again. Before we put out Elliott Smith, I looked at Soundscan, and it showed that half of the sales of Roman Candle had been in Portland, and he was basically unknown everywhere else. I figured that if anyone could be wildly popular in one town, then that could be replicated everywhere, all you have to do is get the word out. But Elliott Smith really didn't sell that well. 

Part of that was context: At Kill Rock Stars, everything that we had put out to that point was either a sort-of-loud, guitar-based, technically-interesting indie rock band like Unwound or godheadSilo or Universal Order of Armageddon, or it was associated with the Riot Grrrl scene, like Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, and Huggy Bear. And Elliott was really different. So when we sent this acoustic solo singer-songwriter record out to press and college radio, they just went, "Oh, I don't get what this is supposed to be.” Reviewers wouldn't review it. It just got ignored. I don’t think they listened to it and passed on it, I think it just sat on their desk. 

And the other thing was this strong anti-singer-songwriter bias in the early 90s—because indie rock was still coming out of the punk tradition, it was anti-a lot of the things the 70s had been known for, including heartfelt singer-songwriters. So anybody with an acoustic guitar singing under their own name was instantly going to be compared to James Taylor, no matter what they sounded like. People just rolled their eyes, straight off. Maybe there were a couple other people, like Bill Callahan as Smog, and Lou Barlow as Sentridoh, who were doing that, but they were performing under band names. So it was bold of Elliott to perform under his own name. 

JJ GONSON: It was embarrassing to be doing acoustic music. Nobody did it. Everybody was rough. There was no pop going on at that time. Elliott and I used to play Peter Paul & Mary, Beatles, and Captain and Tennille covers together in the bedroom with the door closed, hoping nobody could hear us. I will never forget Neil laughing the first time Elliott played him a solo song, the part where his voice goes up on on “No Name #1”. Laughing. It was just shocking. 

I can't not acknowledge the fact that we are talking here about Portland, Oregon, in the 90s: This was O.H.—Original Hipster—so you had a lot of deeply ironic listening material like whale songs or Halloween Sound Effects records, or Tito Puente, or some Spanish movie soundtrack. And Portland itself is very rugged—there's a lot of Bad Company. [laughs] 

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: I remember one night we did karaoke with [Sleater-Kinney/Quasi's] Janet [Weiss] and [Smith bandmate] Sam [Coomes], and me and Janet did "Ride Captain Ride" together. Elliott might have done Rush.

ROB SCHNAPF [producer, Heatmiser’s Mic City Sons, along with Either/Or, XO, and Figure 8; married to Margaret Mittleman]: He actually did “Rock You Like a Hurricane” by the Scorpions. The look on Elliott’s face when he realized how high Klaus Meine’s voice is on that first note—the the realization of having miscalculated in public with a microphone in your hand—oh, it was good.

JJ GONSON: We were huge Elvis Costello fans, too. I remember sitting with Neil and Elliott in the living room at their house with our heads down listening to Brutal Youth. Amazing record. When Elliott was on tour, I went to see Elvis Costello and he was fucking furious. 

He would walk up behind me and put his arms around me and sing [the Carpenters'] "Close to You" to me. At one point when we were falling apart, he made me a beautiful cassette recording of the Cheap Trick song "If You Want My Love". I wish I knew where it was, but I don't.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: When I would tell the other bands I was working with that I was working with Elliott Smith, they’d be like, “Oh, why? That’s weird.” Eventually, of course, they became his biggest fans.


Between 1994 and 1996, Smith tours regularly as a solo artist while remaining the co-frontman of Heatmiser. 


SLIM MOON: A couple of the shows we played on that Roman Candle tour in 1994 were really poorly promoted, so we'd goof off, and Elliott would play a lot of Hank Williams and stuff. There was one show that was in a sports bar in Santa Cruz where there was no one there except the regulars, who were really bummed that we were bogarting their dartboard area. And I had really bad gas—I was farting up a storm. Elliott was cracking jokes about the smell in between songs, to the amusement of no one but me.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: Elliott’s first solo tour on the East Coast was painful because he was still becoming comfortable with performing alone—and not just alone, but alone to an empty room. He was nervous about it, and it used to make him… not feel good a lot. He dealt with a lot of stomach issues. So I'd always be the one telling him, “You can do it.” But whether it would be one person or five, somebody inevitably would discover him from that one experience, and the next time he went back, it was easier. 

ROB SCHNAPF: He used to play these shows and he wouldn’t finish songs and he would just kind of give up, and Margaret would be like, "Nope, you’re gonna go out there, you’ve gotta finish your songs, go back up the stairs." He'd say, "What if someone’s talking?" And she'd say, "Who cares? You wanna do this, right? Well, this is what you’ve gotta do. You’re gonna be playing this bowling alley in Nebraska next. Good luck."

MARY LOU LORD: [singer/songwriter; tourmate; KRS labelmate]: Slim really liked this kid. We were all together on a bill; me, Slim, and Elliott. I was backstage, just talking to everybody, and Slim said, “Mary Lou, you really need to go out and watch that guy.” I wasn't very interested; I had heard a million acoustic guitar guys, you know? But Slim was like, “No, Mary Lou, you really need to go and watch him.” In other words, “Shut the fuck up and get out there.” 

The first thing I noticed was that his guitar was really crappy; I think it might have been the Le Domino he recorded Roman Candle on. I realized he was making that crappy guitar sound really good. By the third song, I had completely lost myself. I was sucked in. I immediately invited him on tour. And he mumbled, in his way, “OK, Mary Lou.”


Watch Smith play "The Biggest Lie" live circa 1995; footage shot by Mary Lou Lord:







SLIM MOON: The biggest bands that Kill Rock Stars ever put out each got their momentum in a different way. Sleater-Kinney's biggest momentum was from the press—that, second to Radiohead, they got more positive press than any other band in America in the 90s. With the Decemberists, it was the public: The indie rock record-buyers, the kids, went crazy for that band, but critics kind of shrugged at the time. When Elliott Smith came out, it was falling on deaf ears. But artists were reacting to it. So there was a Fugazi interview where they mentioned that they'd heard the record and liked it. And then John Doe took Elliott on tour, and Sebadoh took Elliott on tour, and in a Beastie Boys SPIN interview, they mentioned his record.

LOU BARLOW [frontman, Sebadoh]: He opened solo for Sebadoh in ‘96, and it was at a time when no one really knew about him. We were at our peak at that point, and people just talked right through his set. It would make me really angry. I'd be like, "What the hell are you doing talking through his set? It's Elliott Smith! He's great!" I had that feeling like, “Someday you idiots will shut up and listen to him.” I remember telling him, "People won't shut up, it's making me so angry." And he's like, "I like it better this way. It makes me less self-conscious."

STEVEN DROZD [drummer/multi-instrumentalist, the Flaming Lips]: I met Elliott in '96. I was on that Sebadoh tour with Those Bastard Souls. I was very intimidated by him when I first met him. He just seemed like such a fucking serious dude. He was kind of a nobody back then, but he already had something about him. Between him and Lou Barlow, I was pretty struck. I treaded lightly. 

REBECCA GATES [singer/guitarist, the Spinanes]: We toured together for [The Spinanes’] Strand in 1996. I would never really sit down and play, except for during soundcheck and shows, but when we showed up anywhere, Elliott would just start playing guitar, whether he was writing, or practicing, or just playing covers. It wasn't like, "Here I am, check me out!" It was just to himself. He was someone who was always thinking about songwriting.

We were a pretty silly crew on tour. One time I was sitting shotgun in the van with my head in a book, and I heard all this snickering behind me. I turned around and [Elliott] had taken electric tape and made an Abe Lincoln beard on his face. And every time I kept turning around, more people had this electric tape facial hair.

MARY LOU LORD: We both applied to South By Southwest around 1995 and we got turned down. So I said, "Elliott, who are those assholes to tell us we can't play?" I had this little busking amp I kept in my car at all times, just in case. So we drove down there and found a little place to play near the Driskill Hotel. I kind of wore the pants on that tour [laughs], and Elliott was like, "I don't know about this, Mary Lou." And I was like, "That's enough outta you. We're going to have our own little showcase out in front of this Kinko's."

We got a bunch of booze and started playing. I wish to god somebody had recorded this, because it was St. Patrick's Day, and Elliott was playing all kinds of Irish songs and Pogues songs. We'd take turns, and we played all night and got happily shit-faced. The people who actually had a showcase at Kill Rock Stars came by; Slim was there. It was one of the best nights of my life.

SLIM MOON: It was particularly great at that time because her and Elliott had been touring together and were really tight. There was always a huge, huge circle of people around them.

MIKE DOUGHTY [frontman, Soul Coughing]: I saw Elliott in New York with the Magnetic Fields on the same bill. No one had heard of either them. It was literally a life-changing show. I was like, "I don't want to do Soul Coughing anymore. I want to do this—when I grow up, I want to be this man." I went out the next day to whatever groovy-people record store was closest and bought Roman Candle and Elliott Smith. 

The thing that I always keep in mind is the hiss from the tape on Elliott Smith; those were not sounds that an engineer would be particularly proud of. And there's some lyrics from "Christian Brothers" that I want to put up in neon across the length of Metropolitan Ave. in Brooklyn: "No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around." I'm getting chills right now just saying that.

I met him shortly after that. We were at [Manhattan venue] Brownie's and we were talking songwriting and records. At the time, he didn't do drugs, and I didn't drink, which kind of limited our hang. But I remember him saying, “Why are there no more drummers that just pound out the two and the four on the snare, like on old Sam Cooke records? Why do drummers have to be complicated?" And you can hear that on his records and in his own drumming. He hit the snare on the two and the four and then hit a ride cymbal every once in a while for emphasis. He didn't need some crazy attention-drawing drum part to make the song a song.

I just wanted to do something with him, and between Either/Or and XO, he came down to my studio. I sat him in front of a binaural head, which is this grey foam sculpture of a human head with two specialized microphones in each ear hole that has this incredibly realistic stereo effect. So we sat down in front of this ludicrous device and he sang two songs, which became other songs later—one was "The record that plays over and over/ There's a kid in the story below" lines from "Bottle Up and Explode!" The other one ended up as "Going Nowhere”. I didn't have anything good to add to them, but I have these a cappella versions. I wish I knew where I put them.

LOU BARLOW: I related to him in a lot of ways because when he was in the zone of performing acoustically, he was just hunched over. I mean, the guy didn't really ever look up. There was none of this, "I'm a performer," you know? Almost no acknowledgement. There was almost an anger that I really related to.

I remember he was soundchecking in Philadelphia at the Theatre of Living Arts. I would always watch his soundchecks, so I was sitting there, and he covered "Thirteen" by Big Star. It just brought me to tears. Music doesn't always bring me to tears; if I hear "Love" by John Lennon at a vulnerable moment it will bring me to tears. His version of "Thirteen" was devastating in that empty theater. I don’t think he even knew I was there.


Watch Smith cover Big Star's "Thirteen" at a Sydney, Australia, show in 1999:







DORIEN GARRY [friend, publicist at Girlie Action Media]: I first met him around 1995, when I was 17 or 18 and working the door at Maxwell’s. It was a Sunday night, and he was on tour with the Softies. Not very many people showed up to the gig. None of those guys had a place to stay, and I lived in kind of a halfway house for musicians in Jersey City at the time, so they stayed there for the night.

Totally coincidentally, within the next six months or so, I got hired at Girlie Action to do publicity and I worked for him. I handled the college fanzine stuff, and we became pretty close during that short span of time. Elliott and I both collected and read fanzines.

In the beginning, that part was actually sort of fun for him, because it was like a game. It took a long time for him to develop a love-hate relationship with the press room. So he would tell me a list of fanzines that he wished some day would interview him, and then we’d see if we could make it happen. That was such a different time in the music industry. There was no internet; fanzines were our internet—and using the post office was our information superhighway, I guess. [laughs]

Because we were friends, he was able to tell me what he was and wasn't comfortable with. The more attention he got, the more troubled he got, and that’s when it got hard. The irony of it was that he was so open and honest with pretty much anybody who crossed his path, so it wasn't unlike him to tell a very personal, private story to a virtual stranger sitting next to him at a bar.

But it would infuriate him when people asked him what his lyrics were about. He really hated having to have an answer for what every character and every story was. Music was a way of channeling thoughts and feelings that were bigger than him into art, and he didn’t feel like he owed every single person an explanation of what everything was about.

I mean, “Needle in the Hay” is obviously about drugs and despair. But I when I got to know him better, I learned that song was more about what was going on in the Pacific Northwest in the small music community in the early 90s and how badly drugs were infiltrating it.

LARRY CRANE: His lyrics are parables and observations. The biggest mistake people make is assuming his songs are all confessional. It's his own life, but it's a lot of allegory. You see recurring characters in his songs.

JJ GONSON: It always surprised me which pictures of mine that he loved. That one of people falling that's on the front of Elliott Smith—he loved that one, and I wouldn't have even noticed it.

REBECCA GATES: When I sang backup vocals on "St. Ides Heaven", he was so focused on how he wanted things to sound. I have a weird way of singing harmonies sometimes and I just remember him remarking on that: "Ah, I wouldn't have gone for that note, but it works great.” Maybe this has shifted now with digital recording, but the one thing that was really special about having those chances to record back then was that it didn't happen all the time. It was this really lovely space that you created. 

LOU BARLOW: When I would play Elliott's music in the house, my wife at the time was pissed. She's like, "This sounds like Sebadoh! It sounds like your acoustic stuff!" She was just livid about it. I couldn't really hear it, though; I heard much more of a folk tradition with him, and his music was more elaborate, where my stuff tended to be simpler.







Either/Or (1997)

Either/Or, Smith’s final album for Kill Rock Stars, is released on February 25, 1997. Portions of it are recorded at his then-girlfriend Joanna Bolme’s house; at Mary Lou Lord’s home studio; and in the basement of engineer/producer Larry Crane. Smith and Crane, after becoming friends, go onto build and open Jackpot! Recording Studio. 


LARRY CRANE: I kind of knew who Elliott was through Joanna [Bolme], because she worked at La Luna. We were throwing some random party, and everyone was sitting around the backyard having a barbecue. Joanna and Elliott were there, and that’s when I first remember showing them my home studio, and Elliott saying, "Oh, I have the same tape deck as you, maybe I could come over here and do some vocals over that." The next thing I know, we were tracking the vocals for “Pictures of Me”. When we recorded that song, I remember turning to him and saying, “Oh, you like the Zombies?"

We both wanted to go in on a studio together. I had this beat-up little Toyota pickup and we’d drive around Portland just looking through “For Rent” signs, listening to Simon & Garfunkel and the Left Banke. When we moved into the Jackpot! [Studio] space and started building it, we had a boombox with CDs and cassettes and we listened to all kinds of stuff: Television, the Saints. The only thing that drove him crazy was my obsession with Petula Clark. It didn’t really dawn on me for quite awhile that we were becoming friends.

We built the place in two weeks. Elliott was actually a professional mudder—he used to run around and do different jobs to do with mudding. And mudding is a pain in the ass. There's really an art to it, you have to be meticulous. I’m terrible at it. It was gonna be my studio, my business, my name, but he was gonna have a pro-rated deal. A lot of the people that helped do all the work—we had a big room, we had to put a wall up, paint, all that stuff—we just gave them recording time; you worked for an hour, you get an hour of recording time. We opened Jackpot! in February, 1997. 

Recording sessions were never really long and drawn out with him. Just three or four hours. If it wasn't going the right way, he'd say, "Make a rough mix of it for me, and let's go get a drink." Back then, it felt more like college than work. There was also a lot of silly stuff. One day, he must have seen someone wearing a Big Dog sweatshirt—that brand—and he must have thought it was really funny, because for no reason, he kept going around the studio puffing his chest out and repeating, “I'm a big dog.” He wouldn’t stop until it cracked us up.

Something else funny: A friend dropped off a Casio guitar made out of rubber, and I was supposed to give it to someone but I kept it around. And Elliott loved that thing. He would always strap it on and play, like, Stevie Wonder's “Superstition”. You can actually hear it on "Bled White”; it makes a neener-wheeee sound. He decided he had to bring it to L.A. to show Jon Brion.

DORIEN GARRY: He's been turned into somewhat of an icon, but he was actually a total goofball most of the time. He would prank call me and leave me voicemails. This was before cell phones, so I'd come home and there'd be a message that was him basically doing a whole Jerky Boys skit on the answering machine. 

And he had a real thing about clowns—being fascinated and intrigued by clowns, trying not be scared of clowns. It was a constant joke: Clowns are weird. Clowns are cool. Clowns are rad. When I saw that story recently about the scary clown in Northampton who’s been terrorizing people, the first thing I thought was, “Man, I wish Elliott was here for this.”

We watched All That Jazz together once. It was the rare night where I convinced him to stay home with me and not go out. We both loved it. The main character, who's wreaking havoc on this dance community, is wearing this black leather armband. Halfway through the movie, Elliott's like, "I really like that huge bracelet thing." I'm like, "Yeah, it's pretty badass." And then the next day he's like, "Do you know where I can go get a scrap of leather?" So that's basically where the whole leather armband trend of the 90s came from—Elliott seeing All That Jazz.

LARRY CRANE: We recorded a lot of cool stuff just incidentally. Someone would always be milling about, and then he'd just say, "Hey, can you help me track this?" That's actually how "Miss Misery" came about. He laid down the instrumental and then made a cassette of it. And then at some point he came back from out of town and said, “Hey, play us that one song.” And I’m like, “Which one?” But we put it up and he put all the vocals on it that day.

Whenever we did an early version of a song, he would say “I need to send out a probe." So we'd leave a track open just for him to hear and sing along. He would look for the notes that needed harmonies, and then we’d roll the tape and he’d sing them. He was obsessive about stuff like that. When we were tracking vocals for “Pictures of Me", I was amazed how many layers he built up. The music was all on two tracks, and the other six tracks ended up being vocals. I was like, "That's a little excessive!" [laughs]

I’ve seen very few people that are solo multi-instrumentalist artists that can really work that way. It was very much like a Brian Wilson thing where he locked in. He would be playing a song on guitar and then he’d say, “Maybe this would be better on piano.” And in a split-second he walks over and starts playing it on piano. 

ROB SCHNAPF: We recorded “Between the Bars”, “Angeles”, and “Say Yes” at [Schnapf and Rothrock’s Humboldt County, California, studio] the Shop. He would record one live take of vocal and guitar together, and then he would just double to it once we got it. It was just absurd. The guitar stuff isn’t even easy. It was ridiculous that he was able to just nail a vocal and guitar performance live, and he was able to double it live again. I mean, it’s not like he’s strumming G, C, D. There’s intricate little fills. It sounds so natural, and so simple—then you try to play it. And sing at the same time. He was just really good. Understated, but really good. 

I loved "Angeles". I was excited to be able to record it. We took that one organ note, which he had previously recorded, and looped it. It’s that one pedal tone, and it really felt like… something. I don’t always try to operate on the intellectual level; I like to keep it in the land of feelings and then think about it afterwards if I need to. Recording “Angeles” was a good feeling.

LUKE WOOD [DreamWorks A&R]: The most available example of Elliott's skill as a writer, and his way with metaphor, is probably "Between the Bars". It works on three layers. It's about love, at first, or it seems to be; you could look at it literally, being about going out for a night out at the bars; the imagery could easily be about prison; and, of course, it's potentially about addiction. The clarity and continuity of thought is amazing—he can take a metaphor like that and sing about it for three minutes and never leave.







JJ GONSON: He recorded Either/Or partly at my studio, which was a funny thing because, at that point, we weren't actually speaking to each other. But for months, he was next door to where I worked, so I could hear all these songs being made because my office shared a wall with where he was recording. It was hell. Good songs, though. Really good songs.

MARY LOU LORD: Honestly, I don't even know which songs for Either/Or he recorded at my house. [laughs] We had a room set up at my place, and he basically had a studio in it. Whenever he would come over, he would disappear into it for hours and hours, and we wouldn't disturb him. There were a lot of times where it was like, you know, "Where's Elliott?" And that's what he'd be doing. It was constant. He did that wherever he was; it wasn't just at my house.

JJ GONSON: That was around the time he was breaking away from Heatmiser. It's too bad, he wasn’t actually aware that you could have a conversation with somebody and say, "Look, I want to do some music that isn't Heatmiser, so I want to do this." Instead, he would just shut down and not say anything. So it was all done in this very underhanded way. I don't want to be disparaging of him, but this is just unfortunately how he operated. And then when we split up, I kept trying to juggle his solo career with the band, but I didn't have any communication at that point because he wouldn't let me talk to his manager [Margaret Mittleman]. Or he wouldn't let her talk to me. Or something. And the fact that he and I had broken up and were tearing each other into tiny little pieces emotionally—or at least he was tearing me, I can't speak for him—didn't help.

The way I looked at it: I managed Heatmiser. It was my place as their manager to make sure that they had shows to make money, and that things were scheduled properly, and that the relationship went well with all of our representatives, our label, our booking agent. As he did more and more solo shows, he disconnected from me and from the band. And I know that there were times where Elliott had songs that he wasn't taking to the band because I lived with him. 

It was hard for me as their manager because I knew there was something destructive going on, and I made a decision to support him as a musician and respect his wish that I didn't share this information. But I also knew that the band was done, because he wasn't willing to communicate. I couldn't make a rational decision about how best to manage that situation, so I just tried my best to keep things moving forward and get the bills and taxes paid.

Tony [Lash] and I were like: "We just have to keep it friendly, keep moving, get this record done." Because they had signed a contract with Virgin Records and they had obligations to fulfill. They were supposed to be supporting a record, so they booked a tour, and then Elliott bailed, as I recall. We're like, "What?!" This was after he and I had broken up, and he said, "I am prioritizing my solo career over the band." It was pretty shocking to everyone, because the band had worked really hard for a number of years. It could have been both.

TONY LASH: It was almost mid-tour with Heatmiser when he really wanted to change up the sound of the band. This might've been the genesis of struggles between the two of us, because I was resistant to that, but it was mostly because, as a drummer, I liked playing rock stuff; playing quieter music wasn't really my strong point back then, so I was hesitant. He was immediately frustrated. During that whole time, I remember enjoying playing concerts less, but thinking the music was a lot better. 

I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to Either/Or, because he was recording and finishing it just as tensions were highest. I still haven't really listened to that album. We went down to California to shoot a video for "Plainclothes Man" and I drove around with him and he played it for me. I thought it was good, but there was just a lot of tension at that point.

LOU BARLOW: Somehow, we ended up doing the overnight drive from Phoenix to San Diego together in his car when we were touring together. We just talked the whole time, and that was probably the closest I got to him at that point. At that time in Sebadoh, I was like, "I gotta kick the drummer out. This sucks. He's a really good friend." He'd had some issues moving forward from Heatmiser because those were his buds, and going solo was a big change for him. We discussed changing and sometimes leaving your friends behind for the sake of moving forward creatively and artistically. He was a really smart guy.

On the cover of Either/Or, he's standing in front of this mirror, and I was there the night that picture was taken; our tour manager took that picture, and she also took an identical picture of Sebadoh, with the exact same angle. I've gotta find that somewhere. 

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: When he opened for Mark Eitzel from American Music Club at Brownies in New York in ‘97. He finally got the room to be quiet. That was the big challenge; there was this core audience that would sit up front and be quiet, but at the bar people would be talking and the cash register would be going. There was a Troubadour show where people asked the bar not to ring up anything on the cash register during his set. You could hear a pin drop. That was the first time I remember the vibe being different. People weren't just there to see this next big thing. It was, “I need to see this guy.”

SLIM MOON: One of the side effects of his popularity as a solo artist, which also was a side effect of Heatmiser breaking up, was that Virgin no longer had this attitude like: "It's fine if he does this little solo thing on the side because it's not very important." Now that they thought of his solo career as valuable, he was really unhappy with Virgin, so he wanted to leave and go elsewhere. My own perception was that although it kind of sucks to be stuck in a contract you signed a long time ago, when you're having success, it gives you some leverage. I felt like it was a good problem to have; he may have just felt like it was a problem.







XO (1998)

In 1997, Elliott Smith is bought out of his Virgin contract by DreamWorks. He settles into Sunset Studio, on Sunset Boulevard—the studio where Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street, Led Zeppelin II and IV, and Beck's Odelay were recorded , among others—with producers Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock to begin sessions for XO, his DreamWorks debut.  


LUKE WOOD: Someone gave me Roman Candle from Cavity Search when it came out. I was just starting to do A&R in the record business, and I remember being in my Volvo 240 in Silverlake, which is every bit the cliche it sounds like, sitting in front of my house playing the songs over and over again. It was the punkest record I had heard in so long. He played it on an acoustic guitar, but the lyrics were so intense, and his voice was so believable. At the time, if I remember correctly, he was listed under his birth name of Steven Smith. I called him up; I was working at Geffen Records at the time, and he was in Heatmiser. He was really sweet and very appreciative, but said, "I'm cool, thank you very much." I didn't speak to him again until maybe 1997. By then, I was pretty much fanatical. Elliott Smith and Either/Or had come out, and both of those were my favorite records of those respective years. So when I went to DreamWorks to start my A&R career, Elliott was foremost on my mind. 

LENNY WARONKER [DreamWorks co-CEO]: Tom [Rothrock] and Rob [Schnapf] came to see me when we first started DreamWorks. They played us Elliott Smith, among other things. It was something from Either/Or, I think, and I said, "What the hell is that?" Just the sound of his double-tracked voice and the acoustic guitar was so unique—maybe there was some George Harrison in there, but what he was doing was uniquely his. And they said, "No, that's not available."

It was pretty much predetermined that he was gonna move from Heatmiser, but there was still the Virgin/Capitol part, and Elliott had to sort of do that himself. He had a contractual obligation there, both as Heatmiser and as a solo artist. I had a meeting with Margaret and the President of Capitol Records, Gary Gersh, who was very cool. He didn't want to force somebody to stay with him. He knew how great Elliott was, and did what he could to keep him, but he didn't want to do it over a gun.

Later on, Margaret, Elliott, and I met for lunch. The first 40 minutes of that meeting were really rough because he's so shy and doesn't say much. He had an orchestration book under his arm and I actually pointed to it said, "What do you have there?" That opened the conversation and then it was a good solid hour of talking about music and some of the artists that I had been associated with that really affected him. He was saying, "I'm gonna start thinking about using an orchestra on my record." He was testing my response, I think. So I went into my Randy Newman and Van Dyke Parks speech about how interesting it is when you orchestrate and go beyond just rock, and I think that pushed some of his concerns aside. I mentioned the right artists, and he relaxed. 

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: It definitely started with Lenny. Elliott felt good knowing it was one of the top guys behind him, because it was a big, big jump.

ROB SCHNAPF: Here’s the thing about Either/Or: It could easily have been bigger-sounding. We could have blown it up more, but he wasn’t ready to do it just yet. He was heading that direction, though. Elliott never did anything he didn’t want to do. With XO, we didn’t have any specific conversation about it, but I could tell: He was just ready. 

TONY LASH: Maybe he kept things low-key in the beginning as a deliberate way to distinguish his solo material from Heatmiser. I can only speculate, but it seemed like that to me. So, freed from the constraints of Heatmiser, he could incorporate whatever he wanted into his songs.

LENNY WARONKER: He never felt intimidated musically and he was quite open about things in the studio. We didn't stop by often, but when I was there, if I had a thought—even if it was bad—he would listen. It was almost like he was taking notes. I made some reference to the Beach Boys at one point, suggesting the possibility of adding an odd instrument, maybe a woodwind, and rather than either file it away or just go "no," he was intrigued by it.

The harmonies and the vocal parts were so much more predominant on XO, and that gift, along with all the other gifts that he had, was a surprise. It shouldn't have been; you could tell from his earlier records that it was there, but not to that degree. He completely stepped up. I was so taken by what he was doing. 

His stuff was always so precise. Most great songwriters are very economic, and he was, outside of Randy Newman... well, I shouldn't say it this way. But he was as good as it gets when you're talking about layers within lyrics. There was so much in it with so few words, and as fragile he sounded, he was in complete command. 

ROB SCHNAPF: He was brisk in the studio. Speed was never the focus, but at the end of day one we had “Waltz #1” basically done. We came back the next day and added that big old bass drum to it, and added strings to it after that, but the meat of the song—vocals, everything—was done.

Songs would just come up. Maybe they weren’t necessarily written in the studio, but they'd be written while we’re making the record. It’s hard for me to say exactly what the deal is, but in this case there was a convergence of inspiration and it made something happen. A lot of times, I think he had stuff kicking around for years. His dad had told me they were very similar in that way, because his dad was a painter. He was like, "I work on a painting and then I put it away for 10 years, and all of a sudden I know how to finish it." So he carried bits around.

TONY LASH: There was a song on XO that was probably the best song we did, as Harum Scarum, back in 1989 or 1990. He reworked it for XO, and turned it into "Everybody Cares, Everybody Understands". The old song was called "Catholic". That was surprising to me. I think he ended up doing more of that later, pulling out really old ideas and reworking them.

LARRY CRANE: I was there when they did the horns and string overdubs on XO. They brought [string arrangers] Shelly Berg and Tom Halm in to flush out the ideas that Elliott had played out on a keyboard the week before. He gave them the MIDI files and talked to them about what he wanted, and they went and arranged it and played us these synthetic strings, as a mockup. Elliott was silent the whole time. Then we shake hands and say “OK, we’ll see you at the string session in a couple days." The minute we're back in the suite, Elliott turns to me and says, "Oh man, I don't like what he added, but I don't want to offend the guy." And Tom [Rothrock] overheard that and was like, "Wait a minute, what did you say to Larry!?" So we march back there, and Elliott tells them what he doesn't like, and Shelly says, "Yeah, you basically stripped it back to what you gave us in the first place.”

I’m a lot more cavalier, I guess; if it’s a hired-gun arranger, and I have to change or throw away what they're doing, I don’t give a fuck—the only thing that matters is if the artist is happy and the record comes out as good as we can make it. I was blown away that he would even half-think that way. He just didn’t want to ever have an issue or conflict or bum other people out, but by doing that, ironically, he usually bummed people out anyway. He could be really stern with me, and he would be stubborn, within Heatmiser, about what he wanted. 


Watch the video for XO's "Baby Britain":







Around this time, Smith contributes the original song “Miss Misery” to the Good Will Hunting soundtrack. Soon after XO sessions are underway, they are interrupted by the news that the track has been nominated for an Oscar.


GUS VAN SANT [director, Good Will Hunting]: I knew about Heatmiser, and I saw them one time at Pine Street [later changed to La Luna], which was the center of a lot of alternative bands during the 80s. But I didn't really know too much about their music. Mostly I had these these two CDs from my friend Steve Birch, who worked for a lot of bands because he was an artist and designed covers. He’d picked up a bunch of CDs for me from this store called Locals Only around 1994, and Roman Candle was in the pile. Elliott’s music was something I just happened to put on at one point. It reminded me of Simon & Garfunkel. Although, before I met Elliott, someone said, “Don't mention Simon & Garfunkel to him.”

As I do with most films, I try and find some music that you could use throughout, not just a sampling of lots of different artists. And I thought it might be interesting to try that with Elliott. I told the editor, Pietro Scalia, who's now one of the most expensive editors in Hollywood, to try his music and it just worked. As soon as we decided we really did want it for sure, the next step was to ask Elliott whether that was OK. My boyfriend worked with Joanna in a bar, so he got me the number and I just called him up.

LARRY CRANE: I was out running errands or doing something, and I come back around and Elliott goes, “Oh, Gus Van Sant came over and I played him that song we recorded.” And I’m just like, “What! I wasn’t here?!" 

JJ GONSON: I remember hearing vaguely about Good Will Hunting, early on. I knew Gus was in town, I think. Elliott and I weren’t speaking much by then. He started dating Joanna and just as I was his world, she was now his world. I certainly didn't hang out with him. We were not friends at that point.

LARRY CRANE: The studio asked if we had anything original and unreleased we could put in there, and we played them "Miss Misery", and they thought it was great. Later, I was in the middle of a session, and I got this phone call like, “This guy’s going to show up to grab the tape.” They put a guy on a plane in L.A., and he flew up, and got in a limo—it wasn’t just a goddamn cab, it was a limo—and pulled up in front of the studio later that same day. He grabs that one reel, jumps in the car, and goes back to the airport to fly back to L.A. What a joke. 

Rob Schnapf and Tom [Rothrock] remixed the song down there, and then they basically had to pretend that it had been written for the movie in order to get an Oscar nomination. Elliott couldn't say it was actually tracked before he'd even heard of Good Will Hunting! It doesn’t matter now, you know? [laughs] 

SLIM MOON: Either/Or came out in February of '97, and Good Will Hunting came out later that year. But I had put out a lot of expensive records all in one year, and had kind of overdone it, and we were a small operation. It was just three of us in an apartment, and I didn't have any line of credit or anything. I had gotten myself in a situation where I owed the manufacturer of the records a tremendous amount of money, and it was going to be four months before I started to see money trickling in from all of it. I had really screwed up.

So I was in my bedroom at the Las Vegas Hilton, of all places, at the National Association of Recording Merchandisers convention—I wasn't there just gambling away the money that I didn't have [laughs]—when Elliott's publisher called me and said he'd been nominated for an Oscar. That saved our business.

ROB SCHNAPF: I remember going into the studios and doing vocals and piano on “Miss Misery” pretty early in on XO, and all of a sudden he gets nominated for an Oscar and it just changes everything. It became really hard for him because, for one, he’s playing everything, so he never has a break: Elliott plays drums, then plays bass, then plays guitar, then plays piano, then sings. And before that, he would have interviews from like 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. talking to people, international press, all over the place.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: All of a sudden, he had to do interviews for Us and People and all these magazines that wouldn’t have touched him. And they don't care who you are. They just want to talk about this one song. We were trying to focus on recording XO, but my memory of that time is all about just getting him to sit down in the lounge of Sunset Sound to do interviews. 

GUS VAN SANT: As soon as the nominations came out, all of us were assigned different campaign duties. Elliott played in a little club in TriBeCa near the Weinstein Company, which was partly organized by the movie promotion. It was just a simple thing, but it wasn't his own thing, so he was all nervous. He didn't really know what to wear, so he just put on some slacks. With his schedule, he didn't have a place to change, so he changed on the subway platform and got reprimanded by a cop.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: We had to go to Capitol Studios and rehearse with the orchestra for the Oscar performance. They were impressed with his knowledge working with an orchestra and writing out his piece. We had a trailer, which was a trip to him. We saw the stage and what the audience was going to look like; there were all the signs on the chairs saying who was going to sit where. 

They were trying to figure out how he would come out, how to make him perform. They wanted him to sit on the set of stairs that everyone would walk up to get to the podium, and we tried that. They really wanted him to be the guy who comes out and sits on the stairs. I walked out to [Oscars producer] Gil Cates, kind of shaking and saying, “I’m sorry, that can’t happen. He’s not going to do that.” Elliott wouldn’t say anything, so I had to do all that, which was very stressful.

ROB SCHNAPF: It was scary because they were like, “We want you to play with a rope as a guitar strap.” “Nah, I don’t want to do that.” “Well that’s what we want you to do.” “Well, I don’t want to do that.” “I want you to sit on the steps.” “Nah, I don’t want to do that.” There was this feeling: “Well, we’re the Oscars, who are you?”

LARRY CRANE: The Oscars people came to Margaret and said he’s only going to be playing a verse and a chorus, and Elliott was like, “I don’t want to do it then." Simple as that. So they said they’d just get someone else to play his song: “Here’s Billy Joel!” Or it’s Matt Damon in a top hat.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: The day of the ceremony, me, Rob, Joanna, and Elliott pulled up to where all the limos were pulling up, and I was trying to figure out how to get Elliott down the red carpet, which was chaotic. The four of us started to walk down one side, but Rob and I got pulled away, like, “This is the side you go on.” The photographers were just trying to figure Elliott out. Nobody knew who he was.

GUS VAN SANT: He had a white suit, and it was kind of amazing. As soon as the curtains parted, I saw that the entire stage was decorated as the Titanic. I thought, "Oh, I see." Hollywood was so excited that they had a movie that grossed a billion dollars and they were gonna show it. So Celine Dion had a full orchestra. Elliott had a little bit of an orchestra, too, but it was all very tiny in comparison. They used a lot of fog for the show, presumably because it was the Titanic, and it made me very sick—three hours of that stuff blowing on you and you just get a severe hangover.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: We met Matt Damon and Minnie Driver. Minnie started hanging out with him after that—I think they may have had a little thing for a while. I don’t know if it was anything serious, or if she just got into his music. Then there was the Governors Ball dinner that everybody goes to right after the whole event ends, which was pretty hilarious. We sat with Fay Wray, who was in the original King Kong. Elliott met that guy who played the detective in Jackie Brown, Robert Forster, too.

But the highlight of that event for Elliott was that Celine Dion made him feel comfortable, from backstage to onstage. It really was amazing. She made him really feel at home, like he was one of them.

ROB SCHNAPF: Celine Dion was really awesome to him. She really was.


Watch Smith perform "Miss Misery" at the Oscars in 1998:







LARRY CRANE: I knew it had no chance in hell of winning. I was hoping it would, but come on; it’s up against the song from Titanic. It’s funny, the woman I’m married to now was my friend at the time, and she came and picked me up and we went and watched the Oscars at La Luna. We had so much history with Elliott and Joanna there, and it was awesome because it was queer night at La Luna, so we went and watched it with all these wonderfully raging queens, who were like, “Oh look, there she is, oh my god, she’s beautiful!” whenever someone came onstage.

GUS VAN SANT: The Oregonian wrote a really catty review of the Oscars saying they were boring, and that Elliott's appearance was “grunge lite.” They were just making fun of the whole thing. But through all the sort of showbiz-y stuff associated with the Oscars, he was happy that it was the one thing that his mother could tell her friends her son had done. He was a singer, yes, but now he'd been nominated for an Academy Award. He was really happy.

We mostly went our separate ways after that. I went to a show at the El Rey and, I think because I was a movie guy, I was always looked at like, "What's this guy doing here? Who the fuck does he think he is?" I didn't find a comforting home in his music crowd.

REBECCA GATES: If one of your friends is suddenly performing on the Oscars, there's a sense that something's shifted: a shift in opportunities, a shift in who's paying attention. I just loved that he was hanging out with Celine Dion. He was like, "Hey guys, you get so many weird gifts when you go the Oscars." He felt weird about it; it was a cool thing, but it was a weird thing. There's a part of being good friends where you try to keep things normalized.  We just said, "You looked hilarious up on stage. You did a good job, it was excellent."

DORIEN GARRY: He had tremendously low self-esteem, so it was very awkward for him to all of a sudden be revered by so many strangers. Ultimately, I think that was the hardest and most confusing thing for him. He couldn't understand what the big deal was, I guess.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: There was definitely a pace with Elliott, like, “We’ll get there. Can we just take it a step at a time?” It was my job to get everybody on board with that. He eventually did everything he was supposed to do. Most of it he knew he wouldn’t like, but he did it. Lenny and Luke never really complained.

LUKE WOOD: He was extremely reluctant about promotion in general, but it wasn't because he thought he was too good for it, or because he thought it was selling out. It was really because he felt like the music should speak for itself, and everything else was redundant and irrelevant and silly. “Why do I talk about ‘Waltz #2’? Listen to the song!” He really believed what the song meant to you is what it meant.

I think what Elliott wanted out of his situation was the capital afforded from a major label, because there were things he wanted to do creatively. He tried to find the place that had the most patience and would fuck with him the least; he never wanted to feel like he was singing for his supper. I will say, I felt like he did enjoy the shows. He was reluctant occasionally, when the monitors weren't great or something else was off, because he was a perfectionist and that stuff would drive him crazy. But he'd often come back after a show with a smile on his face and say, "That was fun tonight, I really enjoyed it." 

STEVEN DROZD: We ended up doing some shows in Sweden together with Elliott playing with his full band around '99. I was in pretty bad shape at that point, but we just really hit it off, and next thing I knew we were getting drunk and playing acoustic guitars on his tour bus, driving through Sweden. As miserable as I was on tour at that time—I was really strung out and I couldn't get anything in Scandinavia, and I was going two or three days without really sleeping—he and I would drink whiskey and play Elton John and Big Star songs at four o'clock in the morning on the tour bus. It was incredible.

He and I did ecstasy on the tour bus one night and we were listening to Elton John's Greatest Hits. His favorite was actually "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road", so we played that one a lot. My favorite Elton John song is "Daniel"; my son is named Daniel and he's partly named after my wife's father, but also partly named after that song. So we get to that song and Elliott stops it, and I'm like, "Hey, what are you doing?" He says, "Man, I never liked that fuckin' song. Who is this fuckin' Daniel guy, anyway." I try to tell him it's this character whose brother had been to Vietnam, and how they cut out the last verse because it was too weird, trying to sell him. He wasn't having any of it. "I don't give a shit! Fuck 'Daniel', we're skipping 'Daniel."







Figure 8 (2000)

In 1999, as touring for XO winds down, Smith begins working on what would eventually become its ambitious follow-up, Figure 8.


AUTUMN DE WILDE [photographer, cover art and inserts for Figure 8; director, “Son of Sam” video; author of the 2007 photo book Elliott Smith]: We first met because I knew his manager, Margaret Mittleman. Later, we met on the street in New York and hung out that whole night. Someone had spray painted “freak” in a bunch of places in New York, and he thought it was funny, so the next morning, I took some pictures of him standing in front of the word “freak.” It was a very unofficial beginning. I was in no way pursuing work.

A bunch of time passed and then my manager asked me to submit my portfolio, which was mostly photos of my friends, for Figure 8; I had a photo of Steve Malkmus from being on tour with them, and some photos of Beck, and probably the Eels. Then, at the back of that book was a photo of him, and he realized whose portfolio he was looking at.

One of my first questions was: “Do you want to change anything about how you're portrayed?” He immediately said, "I feel like everybody thinks I just want to sit in little dark rooms and look depressed in my photos. There's never any color or light, but I love color so much." We talked about all the things he loved, like French New Wave. He was a cinephile and he had a great taste in movies. 

He also mentioned being sick of his own clothes, so I said, "Since this is accidentally your uniform because you didn’t want to dress up for photos, maybe we should put you in suits, but it should look like someone's suit who has been gambling for days and sleeping in it, the kind of suit that is a man’s uniform, not someone dressing up." I was really inspired by photos of the "Forgotten Man" during the Depression, when men were wearing the last suit that they had at the time, just trying not to starve to death. It's the kind of suit that is worn in the rain and shrinks on the body and becomes a second skin, which is different than someone who willfully dropped out.

At the time, I wasn’t thinking about the fact that he wore a suit in the "Miss Misery" video or at the Oscars. I was trying to come up with a way for him put on clothes that expressed an idea without feeling, like, “Elliott Smith is changing his image." He wasn’t worried about that, but I was. I didn’t want it to seem like I messed with something that didn't need messing with. 

It soon became clear to me that I wasn’t dealing with someone who was worrying about how he looked, but rather someone who was making sure whatever it was we were doing was telling the right story: looking at what all these photos mean; not taking them if they don’t mean anything; making them have the right relationship with this record. That was the beginning of me feeling very lucky to be working with him.

I was warned by Margaret that he probably only wanted to do the photoshoot for a few hours, and that I should try to get as many photos as I could. But we shot for like 12 hours. People always said that he didn’t like having his photo taken, but I think he didn’t like the process as it had been presented to him up until that point. With us, it was a creative process, and he really enjoyed it; it wasn’t just about 400 photos of Elliott Smith.

LUKE WOOD: Elliott was living in my neighborhood in Silverlake at the time, and he demoed some of the Figure 8 songs at my house, because I had a small studio. He'd be there during the day while I was at work, and I would get to come home and hear these things as they came together, and literally look at his sketchpads of lyrics. Figure 8 is a very specific record. Just like XO, it's different lyrically and slightly more esoteric, but he had a real idea of what he wanted to say.

It was such a joy watching the thought he would put into small things as he wrote: Should it be "to" or should it be "at?" Should it be first-person or second-person? Should this be plural or singular? Where should I put the modifier? He would write five different versions of a sentence, only changing the modifier. His music was unbelievably well-thought-out.

AUTUMN DE WILDE: As far as the cover, I was trying to figure out how to bring color in without it feeling manufactured and artificial in his world. I said, “What if you are who you are, but you’re walking in front of something that doesn't match, like when you are having an argument with someone in front of a really colorful mural.” I grew up in L.A., so I had my first kiss with someone I loved in a parking lot of a Denny’s in Hollywood, and that became a symbol of our love. So I went out to take some pictures of locations. 

I went to a junior high down the street from the Figure 8 wall—well, now it's the Figure 8 wall; then it was The Sound Solutions wall. I have childhood memories of girls getting beat up in the parking lot of the McDonald's next to it. I took photos of a lot of murals and weird signs from Echo Park to Silverlake and asked him, "What if this was our set?" He loved that idea because it was like seeing something he saw every day and didn’t realize how amazing it was, which is a very Los Angeles thing: When you start narrowing your vision to one thing at a time, you start seeing little gems in the Los Angeles landscape.

ROB SCHNAPF: Figure 8 was recorded all over the place, not all at once. XO got really hard to do because of him playing everything, so for Figure 8  I said, "When you have a batch of songs, let me go record them. We can do it in two-week spurts, that way it’s not this huge, epic burden on you." There was one batch where he did it all, another batch where Sam [Coomes] was more involved playing bass. Then we were in England at Abbey Road, and [drummer] Joey Waronker happened to be in town with R.E.M. and we cut a bunch of songs [with him].

I had never been to Abbey Road before then, and I haven’t been back since. On one hand, it’s just a studio. But then I’m moving the U47 [microphone] around and I'm like, "Wow, it’s got those pop filters just like in the Beatles book… oh, wait." All the same shit is in there. The whole week we were there there was this upright piano that sounded so familiar when you played it. I bugged the assistant and he would never tell me anything, but finally he relented and was like, “Uh, 'Penny Lane.'” And not only is it “Penny Lane”, it’s all those songs where you hear that tack piano—and not only Beatles stuff, like “Martha My Dear”. It’s also Odessey and Oracle and Pink Floyd and tons of others. When I got back home and started listening to records, I’m like, "There’s that piano again." I have a picture of it on my refrigerator. 

As it developed, I noticed that Figure 8 was less literal but more impressionistic lyrically and also texturally. There were parts of it that were a little more ethereal. For this record, I wanted to see what he would do with the Boomerang looper, which is a simple thing to make loops. I showed him how to use it and then all of a sudden I had all these little interlude pieces. So while Tom [Rothrock] and I were working on something that required Elliott, he’d be out making those loops, and we’d just use them as segues to get to different things. One turned into a song called “Dancing on the Highway”, which didn't make the record. It’s a really cool song. 

AUTUMN DE WILDE: He requested me to direct the "Son of Sam" video. I was shocked and I think DreamWorks was pretty shocked, too. I hadn’t directed a video before. To their credit, they rolled with it. It was inspired by La Jetée and The Red Balloon. I would never try to get rid of the sadness that was connected to his songs, but there is so much more in them—so much great poetry that represented abstract and direct ways of explaining how you feel to someone. Not everything was a diary. Some of it was role-playing, becoming other people and singing from their point of view.

For Elliott and I, the best part of this video was how funny it was trying to get this balloon to behave. If it was windy we were fucked, you know? I later found out that The Red Balloon had this giant puppeteering crane. Luckily, we did a test day. Somewhere, there is a clip of Elliott slapping his arms in dismay and being overwhelmed by the balloon hitting him in the face for like the 70th time. It was on one of those giant stairways in Echo Park that I think was in a Laurel and Hardy film, and he's at the top. He was just looking really pissed off, like he was gonna get in a fight with the balloon, and then laughing, and then angry again. The art director figured out you had to use fishing poles, and you can see it in one shot. At the end of the video, when the balloon dies, we all got really sad—and then we were laughing hysterically at how attached we had gotten to this badly behaved actor.







TONY LASH: I didn't really dive into Figure 8 very deeply. I could feel the emotional remove when I heard it, and I really didn't like that. XO still seemed more emotionally engaged. I remember telling him that I thought "Waltz #1" was my favorite song on XO, and he was like, "Yeah, that's the best one." That was a nice little re-bonding moment. Then the sound of Figure 8 was like: "Here's a bunch of really good chord changes and notes." But it was missing that feeling of him directly engaging.

DORIEN GARRY: That was the period where things got unhealthy for him physically. He had someone on his crew that was a bad influence. Not someone in his band, but someone who was working for him, who was notorious for getting musicians drugs and doing them with them. It was around the same time that the relationship he’d had cut him off from people for a while. I mean, I knew what a lot of that record was written about, and by that point everything felt so over the top and overwhelming that it was a little bit hard for me to just sit back and enjoy the music. Elliott definitely channelled whatever was wrong in his life or upsetting to him into his music like tenfold.

LOU BARLOW: I saw him at a party in L.A., and he was actually a really good croquet player. I learned croquet from Elliott. Anyway, I said something like, "I think I'm drinking too much." And he's like, "Well, can you feel your liver?" "What do you mean?" "When you drink too much, you can feel your liver literally pulsing from your side." I was poking for it, trying to feel it, and he's like, "Can you feel it?" And I'm like, "No! Where is it?" He's showing me where it is and telling me when it gets really bad, it pops out the side. I think it's something his dad had told him. I was like, "Man, I guess I'm really not that hardcore of a drinker—my liver isn't protruding from my chest."

ROB SCHNAPF: When he was on top of his game, none of that was happening. Did he drink? Yes. But when I go back and think about it, it started happening during Figure 8. It was not in the open. He was definitely not sharing it. But in retrospect, it explained some things. 

JJ GONSON: He wasn't doing any drugs or really drinking very much when we were together. A big part of what tore us apart was talking about wanting to do drugs. I was like, "I just can't be around that." He didn't want me to tell him what not to do. 

DORIEN GARRY: There were a lot of people in Elliott's life during different times. I'm a lucky one in the sense that our friendship managed to stretch across many different phases, whereas a lot of people sort of got cut off or just were not part of it anymore. I maintained a friendship  with him until he died. I mean, I live in Los Angeles now, and I'm not a fan of probably 75% of the people that call themselves Elliott's friends from L.A. I know the ones that are for real, who had healthy friendships with him. I'm always a little bit torn about speaking publicly about him—losing a friend like that is one of the most difficult things that's ever happened in my life. But if I don't do it, you know… the people who are eager and willing to talk are usually not the right people.

From the very beginning, we had a sibling relationship. I met him when I was 18, and you don't really understand a lot of things in the world when you're 18. Emotionally, he was the most vulnerable person I'd ever met at that point. We took care of each other during not-so-fun times in our lives. I never cast judgment on him. I had to figure out a way to be concerned when there were moments to be concerned; there was a way to approach him about it, and a way not to. I think he appreciated the fact I was never going to do it the way he didn't want to hear.

Elliott wasn’t a typical alcoholic or drug addict in the sense that they try to keep it secret from people. He was very honest about what was going on. If there's one thing Elliott was not it's a liar. It was hard. I don't know which is worse: being deceived or having it just be all out in the open like that. It was very, very upsetting to know that somebody I cared about so much was doing something so stupid.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: As things got bigger, I probably talked to him less. My job had changed a little bit; I became a parent. I hired a friend who became my point person for Elliott. I would take the big-picture meetings with him, but as far as, like, "Can you deliver this list of interviews he doesn't want to do, please?" I stopped doing that. At the time, it was like “OK, you stress me out, and I’m stressing you out. Let’s have other people talk to each other and get our message across. I’ll deliver it to her, she’ll deliver it to you.” That just became easier, and I didn’t see anything wrong with that.

But somewhere in there, we lost him. I have my reasons and my thoughts of outside influences, where I feel like a parent, like, “Oh, if only they hadn’t met that person.” As if it were that person’s fault. There were a couple of people who I wish we hadn’t had in his circle at the time, in retrospect.

I became blind to a lot of things. I didn’t know, but other people around me knew. The Rolling Stone[-sponsored tour] didn't seem super fun for him, but he seemed fine. He was doing everything he was supposed to do, but it was a corporate sponsor, you know? All these corporate people at the shows. Not Rolling Stone people, corporate people. They were nice, but it was different: It wasn't a fan, it wasn't me, it wasn't Rob. And then he did the European tour. I was supposed to go on a bunch of those dates, but I cancelled. He just was not pleasant, and I didn't want to be around it. I was supposed to go to Japan and I didn’t. I just wanted him to get through all of it. In hindsight, I see what was happening. He came home a mess.

AUTUMN DE WILDE: His behavior was becoming more erratic. He’s not the first person I’ve experienced this with, where drugs overtake the personality after a certain point. That’s when you see that there is nobody who is enough of an individual to be an individual on drugs—even the most original person on earth, which I think he was. Some people hold onto their friends when they’re sick like that, and some people systematically try to destroy their relationships in order to not drag them down with them. I don’t know how much credit I should give him, but I felt like he systematically destroyed his relationship with anyone he really respected and cared about. Whatever was left of him did not want us around while he was totally down there.

He wasn’t really hiding anything, either, in my opinion. So that meant you were either there to condone it or you were not there to condone it. And I was not there to condone it. The people who are there to condone it—and this was a very common event—are disposable to someone like that, and they become enablers because they’re there for what they need.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: I thought it was time to get off DreamWorks. I met with Anti- [Records] at the time, because I had a good friend there and felt that he could earn money from other outside activities: Remember when the Gap was doing those commercials using musicians in the late 90s? There was interest in Elliott. And this big movie producer, Brad Silberling, was asking him to score a film. I just thought, "There's a million other things you could be doing. You're gonna be fine.” 

We had tried once to have an intervention in Chicago, [circa the Either/Or tour]. Oh my god. He hated us. He never let me forget what I did to him. We’d be having a great conversation, and it would just come up again out of nowhere. It totally reminds me of the child in him, or my own kids, how they hold onto one memory of mom and dad fighting at dinner. He never let me forget how betrayed he felt. He did agree to go. I think he felt the love and the concern, but you just don't do that to him. That’s what he was like: “I’m a different person. You could have dealt with it differently.” 

I visited him at the rehab place in Pasadena, maybe a month after. He finished up the leg of the tour to New York and then went. It was just weird. It felt like there was a difference between he and I. 

Years later, when he started hanging out with Jon Brion wanting to do work with Jon and not Rob is where the lines really got blurred. This would have been around 2001. I just wanted what was best for my husband and for Elliott. By then, he was a different person. Honestly, he wasn’t really nice to me. He came over one day during the Super Bowl—he used to spend every Super Bowl with us—and he looked like Pocahontas. He had long hair, in braids. I just didn’t know him anymore. His girlfriend Valerie [Deerin] came over—that’s another person that should have never been in his life—and he told Rob he wanted to work with Jon Brion.

That was heartbreaking. I didn’t like the delivery; I didn’t like his choice of day, because that was something we’d done together. That was the beginning of the end for me. He came over fucked up with my kids in the house, and I just shut down. I just wanted to protect my husband and my family and myself. And when I quit, that pissed him off. That’s the part that can make me cry. There was no closure. We never got to argue. We never got to hash it out. I was more like, “Just get out of here.” I never was invited to his funeral. His drug abuse had turned him into something he wasn’t when I knew him all these years. 

ROB SCHNAPF: When it happened, he was all fucked up. I had already kind of told him I don’t approve: "You want to smoke crack or whatever, that’s your free will, great. I don’t want to be around it. That’s my decision."

DORIEN GARRY: At one point I probably hadn't heard from him for about four or five months—he wasn’t calling back, and it was pretty upsetting. The day after September 11th, I came back into the house to an answering message from him. He didn't sound like himself—I mean, everybody sounded weird after September 11th, but I knew that things were pretty dark for him at that point. But his message was asking if everyone was OK, talking about how he’s taken the train and gotten off at the World Trade Center, how he’d  done it over a million times. That meant a lot to me. But then I couldn’t get a hold of him again for a long time. He was in a relationship that cut him off from a lot of people at the time. It was really terrible because I’d known him through some dark times already, but he always, always reached out.

SCOTT BOOKER [manager, Flaming Lips; briefly managed Smith]: [The Flaming Lips] did a few dates in Europe with Elliott around '99, and we all got along really great. After that I got a call from him like, "Hey, would you be interested in being my manager?" I was like, "Of course, who wouldn’t? You’re a genius." I didn’t really know what I was getting into. In our first conversation, he was like, "I want off DreamWorks." 

He didn’t want to record for them anymore because he was convinced that they had people following him, that they were breaking into his house, those kinds of things. Which we all know wasn’t true. But I’d be like, “Well, Elliott, I’m not gonna say I don’t believe you, but why don’t we get one of those cameras that you can buy for like five bucks and you take pictures of any car or person that is following you.” And he said, “Well, the cars have blank license plates.” I never said, "I don’t believe you." I tried to be pragmatic and realistic. He even said to me, “Well, it’s probably not really there.”

When the Flaming Lips played a show in L.A. one time, I remember him calling me saying, “DreamWorks are at my house, because my Flaming Lips backstage pass was upside down on the floor." I was like, "Maybe you just dropped it." I was afraid to say those things, but I’d say it casually. And he was like, "No, I remember putting it on my desk.” He’d have a very elaborate reason as to why. It just wasn’t worth arguing with him.

Even though I didn’t think his reasons were sound, I thought I should still let the label know he’s uncomfortable being there and let them have a part of the decision as well. So I went and had a meeting with Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood. I said, "Look, I don’t think this is a good idea for Elliott to not be on DreamWorks, and I know you guys love him, but for whatever reason, he’s uncomfortable with this. What do you guys wanna do?"

Lenny came up with a pretty elegant solution. He was like, "Let’s not say he’s off the label, let’s just let him put this next record out wherever he wants to, as long as it's not another major label." I thought that was very fair of them and I liked that they weren’t going to just drop him. It solved the dilemma of that moment. 

I mean, just think about me as the manager going into Lenny Waronker, this legendary, artist-friendly music-industry person I’ve looked up to my whole life, to go in and saying, "I don’t think we should be on DreamWorks"—a label that any band would want to be on. It was just funny. But to some degree, maybe that’s part of the reason why they agreed to it as well, because they’re artist-friendly. They know that it was something bigger than an artist being mad at his record label. 

LENNY WARONKER: I know Scott and I don't remember that [meeting]. I do remember that Scott was gonna get involved, which I thought might be nice because I liked him. But I don't remember anything like that.

LUKE WOOD: Elliott was trying to find a place where he could be creative and happy. I think he felt somewhat restricted at a major label: having to do interviews, go on tour, have a commercial record. He didn't like that pressure. I deeply respected him as a musician and a friend. He spent a lot of time at my house. He knew my baby. It was a really difficult period. There's a reason I haven't talked about it for 10 years.







From a Basement on the Hill (2004)

In 2001, Smith begins and ends a series of recording sessions with Jon Brion, which fall apart after Brion confronts him about his drug use and self-destructive behavior. By the fall of that year, he contacts producer David McConnell.


DAVID MCCONNELL [producer; From a Basement on the Hill]: I had XO, which was given to me by a colleague, and I really enjoyed it. Well, half of it was great. Half of it I was like, “Well, great song, but I don’t know if I like the recording or the production." And then my friend Shon Sullivan [from McConnell’s L.A band Goldenboy], was playing with him live, and he invited me out to a show at the Wiltern Theater. I was blown away. It was probably one of the best shows I’ve ever seen in my life. So Shon introduced me to Elliott after the show briefly.

A couple of months after that show, at the end of the Figure 8 tour, he had just started recording with Jon Brion but, for whatever reason, he wasn’t happy with that process, so he split ways with Jon and got in touch with me. When he called me he was actually in Big Bear, up in the mountains, and he was like, “Man, I want to start as soon as possible, can I come down tonight?”

I could tell he was really itching to get into the studio and work with a new producer, someone who was gonna do things a little more experimentally. He wanted somebody who wasn’t so formulaic, who was willing to go down the path of discovery with him, and I guess he heard that maybe I would be that guy.

So I told him we should record in my private studio, because that’s where the more experimental equipment was. I told him he was welcome to stay in the house, too, because we had a guest room. The studio was beautiful; my ex-girlfriend actually owned the property, and it was almost like a compound, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. I had named it Satellite Park one day when I was walking around because it felt like I was on the moon or on an observatory somewhere. 

When he showed up, it was around 2 a.m., and he was in two cars; his girlfriend [Valerie Deerin] was driving one car and he was driving the other car, and both cars were full of all of his belongings. I mean everything from his apartment. I was thinking he was gonna show up with a suitcase and a backpack and a couple of guitars, but it was like five guitars, a giant keyboard, amps, and then five suitcases of clothes. He had toys, books, you name it. And then he had medication, and various other things.

He also brought all his his two-inch reels that he was working on at Jon’s house. So we drank a couple of beers and I gave him the tour of the place and everything, and then he goes, "OK, there’s a song on here that I recorded by myself at Jon’s place that I want to keep, that I really like. Why don’t you just mix this song for me and I’ll be back in the morning.” Then he left. He was like, "I’ve got some errands to run right now, I’ve got some stuff I gotta do.” Remember, this is 2 a.m.—well no, by now it’s 4 a.m., because we had talked about my philosophy on recording and producing for two hours.

So I put the reel on the machine and I started listening to the song, just by myself. And the first time I heard it, just pushing up the faders so I could hear the different instruments and his voice, I got the chills. It was one of the most haunting, beautiful songs I’d ever heard. It sounded nothing like the music I’d heard him do before. It sounded way more intricate, way more complex. 

It reminded me of Rachmaninoff, but with lyrics, with a story. Sitting in there alone, I almost had an out-of-body experience because I knew that I was about to work on one of the best things I’d ever worked on in my life. So I spent the next three or four hours mixing the song, which was called "True Love Is a Rose". It's a shame because that song never ended up on the album. He wanted it to be on the album, it was one of his favorites. 

So he finally got back, listened to my mix, loved it, and then he says, "Let’s start recording another song." At this point he probably hasn’t slept in two days.

The next track we worked on was “Shooting Star”. He told me he wanted it to have this psychedelic intensity, to take elements of Hendrix and the Stooges, but create something that couldn’t be compared to anybody else. We slowed down the reel, just slightly, so it would have a euphoric, heavy, psychedelic persona. 

“Shooting Star” has three drum sets: We would do one drum take, and then we would double the drums, and then sometimes triple them. If you listen closely on headphones, you’ll hear the snare drums flailing, because there are three kits going on. He and I talked about that; I’d say "Hey, you know, this sounds great, are you comfortable with having the snares slightly out of time?" And he was like, "Man, I love it." He wanted to embrace the human quality of this sound, that was very important for him.

He wanted "Shooting Star" to be the opening track then. "Coast To Coast", the opener on the album that got released, was another one we worked on together. He recorded the drum tracks at Sunset Sounds studio with Steven [Drozd], from the Flaming Lips, and the poet Nelson Gary’s part at the end. He had two drummers playing live at the same time on that, he told me, and he stood in the middle of the room pointing at each drummer to do the changes, like he was doing his own version of conducting.

STEVEN DROZD: I went to Los Angeles to visit my then-ex-girlfriend and now wife: We'd been broken up for a few years and she'd gotten into a serious relationship and then got out of the serious relationship and I was trying to win her back. I contacted Elliott, and he said, "I know of this Suboxone doctor that's helped me greatly"—which is this drug you take to get off opiates—"and I'm doing some recording. Could you come down and play some drums?" 

So we just set up the two drum kits and played at the same time. I know that you can be a highly functioning drug addict depending on what drugs you're getting into, but to me, it didn't seem like he was affected at all. He was fucking in charge of the session. People think I played drums all over that record, but it really just ended up being one song.

DAVID MCCONNELL: From that first night, he basically moved in and ended up living there with me for many months. And that’s when we did the bulk of the album. We’d be in my bedroom and he’d sit on the bed and play me songs really late at night. He played "King's Crossing" for me on his guitar one night, although that’s not a song we worked on together.

He brought his guitars, but the funny thing about Elliott is he had five of the same guitar, the Gibson ES-330. I never understood it, exactly. I was like, "OK, that’s great, we can use those, but if you want this bigger guitar sound, I encourage you to check out the guitars that I have." On “Shooting Star”, he fell in love with this old 60s Telecaster I have. Most of the really big guitars you hear on that album are that Telly because this guitar just spits at you. 

He was constantly testing me. He always asked me what my favorite albums were, and it was important that they weren’t ones that were super-produced, because his favorite records weren’t slick; they weren’t perfect. Elliott was very adamant not to use Pro Tools because he didn’t want to fix things. That was one of the important things I learned from working with him on that record: The technically-correct performance isn’t beautiful. It's the performance that can’t be replicated ever again.

One of the things that was really fun and worked well was, if we would double a guitar track, we would purposefully de-tune the guitar. So for the first track, we would make it a little bit sharp, and then for the second, we would make it a little bit flat. If you played one by itself it was kind of upsetting, but when they came together, all of a sudden you’d start smiling.

I’d never see anyone use drugs like Elliott before. I knew I couldn’t give him an intervention, because he’d already warned me. I knew that I couldn’t say, "Hey, you have to leave," because if he wasn’t with me, he’d end up somewhere else which could potentially be harmful. I knew that at my place I could at least watch him.

I think I developed an anxiety disorder working with Elliott. He's one of the most complicated people I’ve ever known in my life. Every once in awhile we’d get in an argument, and he’d leave, and we wouldn’t talk for a week. Then he’d call me and say, "This is stupid, let’s go get a beer and talk." That was how the pattern went. The next day he’d be back at my place. But I loved him like a brother. I wasn’t about to turn my back on him. 

It got the point when he really needed his own place to finish the record, so I helped him put together his New Monkey studio, and then continued to work with him there. That went on for months and months, and then we kind of lost track. That was basically the last year of his life. 

LOU BARLOW: I was seeing him more often around that period, too. He was talking about not doing as many drugs. He had been through a really bad period and the spark was kind of coming back. He was in this really bizarre period where he was dressing like Willie Nelson—he would wear these strange silk pants with embroidery down the side and long, flowing shirts. But then he started to look like Elliott again. 

He was accumulating so much gear at that time, too. He was on eBay constantly, managing a slew of auctions. This was for his studio, New Monkey, that he was building in North Hollywood. This guy who was playing drums in the Folk Implosion was also scheming heavily to be in Elliott's band and hanging around Elliott constantly. Every time he'd hang out with him, he'd come back with a different piece of equipment, like, "Yeah, Elliott handed this to me." "What? That's a $750 contraption for Christ's sake!" All of this stuff of Elliott's started accumulating in my practice space. "Wow! Where did you get that bass?" "Oh, Elliott gave it to me last night." "Really? That's a $2,000 bass." He would just be really high and tell the guy, "Yeah, you should take it." 

AUTUMN DE WILDE: As a photographer, I made a decision not to document that time period. That’s not the kind of artist I am. I don’t judge someone who does that at all, but that was not what I was there for. After that point, I was there as his friend until I wasn’t welcomed as his friend. I know he loved me a lot, and I loved him a lot, but it’s not the same person. Everybody who was a close friend basically had to say goodbye twice.

JJ GONSON: I talked to him on the phone around '99, and he was a mess. I hadn't spoken with him in a very long time, because I had to say, "I can't be in touch with you anymore." The last thing he said to me was, "I'll write you a letter." Which of course he didn't do.

He burned every bridge that he crossed. He didn't just say, "Look, I need a break." He took a machete, chopped you into tiny little pieces, poured battery acid on it, then added salt and set you on fire. He did this painful, painful ripping himself away from people thing to protect himself. He genuinely believed, I think, that he was doing the right thing for other people. He had convinced himself that the world was better off not having him in it, for other people.


On October 21, 2003, Smith dies in an L.A. hospital at age 34 after suffering two stab wounds to the chest.


ROB SCHNAPF: He had been calling me the week before [his death], and was like, "Hey, I want to play you what I have for my record." I didn’t call him back. I didn’t know if I felt like dealing with it.

When our son was born in 1999, we got a phone call in the hospital room around midnight. It was Elliott. He was like, "Hey, would it be OK to come and hang out?" So he came down and he was there all night. We wandered the hospital, just hanging out. It was really cool that he wanted to come share that special time with us. Sonny was born at eight in the morning; four years later, Elliott dies on [Sonny's] birthday. We were coming back from taking Sonny to see some big IMAX rocketship thing, and I get a phone call from Luke Wood saying, "Hey, have you heard any rumors?" I was like, "No, why?" He said, "I just heard one that wasn’t good."

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: I remember Sonny bopping around the backyard in his spacesuit. We were just having a family day. It was so bizarre because I had felt so removed. Somebody called Rob. I didn’t get the call. That made me feel even worse. 

ROB SCHNAPF: It was absolutely devastating. It’s one of those things: You know one day your parents are going to die, and then they die, and it’s still devastating, no matter how much you’re prepared for it. A lot of people said, "Well, you must’ve not been surprised." But I was still fucking surprised.

AUTUMN DE WILDE: He died on my birthday, which has nothing to do with me except it happened to be my birthday. Then every birthday that follows, there’s a period of mourning and a little sadness and I’m thinking, "Am I being really dramatic?" Part of what helps is imagining him laughing at me and just being like, "C’mon, dude. This isn’t a movie about your life where the perfect, crazy dramatic ending is on your birthday."

STEVEN DROZD: We were in Seattle playing the last show of a tour opening for the Chili Peppers, and a very small percentage of the crowd cared about seeing us. We found out that night. It was just awful. I'm gonna start crying just thinking about it now. It was just so brutal. It fucked me up because I went to a bar in Seattle to try to escape, and then everyone in the bar is talking about it. People were visibly upset, crying. It was crazy.

DAVID MCCONNELL: I wasn’t involved in the completion of [From a Basement on the Hill], which was interesting, because Elliott and I had already mixed several songs for the album that were done. After his death, the family took over and brought in some really talented folks, but they hadn’t been around for the process, so they didn’t really know the plans he had for the record. I thought it was odd. I don’t blame them, but I think they probably felt uncomfortable including me in the process because they equated me with that part of his life when he was using and not at his best. Maybe they thought that I was one of the bad guys. I really don’t know, I can’t speak for them. But it was unfortunate because there are many things that are different than what he wanted and planned for on that record.

Here’s something I thought would have been groundbreaking: Two songs—"A Passing Feeling” and “Shooting Star”—were gonna be mixed in mono all the way up until a certain point where they’d break into stereo. We mixed those two songs that way, and there were moments when we cried listening to them. The impact was so profound. Anyway, the family never found those mixes for whatever reason. Also, the fact that it’s missing two of the best songs is too bad. One of them is “True Love Is a Rose” and the other one was called “True Friends / See You in Heaven.” It’s not that I’m bitter about that stuff, I just think the record would have been even more impactful. But I wasn’t going to stick my nose in the family’s business. They had just lost their son and they were grieving. It wasn’t my place to do that.

ROB SCHNAPF: Dave [McConnell] was kind of an asshole. I always tried to be really straight with him. Elliott stopped working with him—I don't know why—and he just felt like he knew exactly what Elliott wanted. Then he talked shit about me in the press without ever talking to me.

Elliott’s sister [Ashley] had all the information and she had been talking to Elliott a lot. She felt like she had a good understanding of where he was going. There was one song, "Abused", that the family didn’t want on the album. Then there was another song called “Suicide Machines” that I thought was just asking for trouble if we included it. We just went through what was completed and worked off a sort of projected track order that Elliott had. There was stuff that wasn’t finished, too. I don’t even remember the names of the songs. I’d heard rumors about all this other material, but we never found it. I never heard it.

I had not worked on a friend’s record who had died before. It was weird to hear him be very alive on those tracks. You would hear him go, “Let’s do this.” You’d hear him take a drag, inhale, blow out. You’d hear the piano stool creak, and you'd think, "He’s alive." It was weird because, with all that stuff, you wouldn’t normally think about it, like how you don’t notice the hum of the refrigerator until the house is absolutely silent and it’s three in the morning. 

I was hoping for it to be a cathartic release, knowing at the same time it was never going to be how he planned it, because he wasn’t there. All you could do was try; it was better than silence. It was positive and exciting on one hand, but the thing that bothered me was reading criticism about it that was unfounded. What were the options? Would you prefer to never hear the record? 

People were saying of that album, “Oh, I like this version better, I liked the early versions better.” What? There was nothing different. We didn’t do anything. I didn’t record anything. I took what was there and mixed it. So all those things that are unresolved are to be that way. Unresolved.

It’s a cool, beautiful record. He wrote it when he was alive. He didn’t write it when he was dead, he didn’t write it after a suicide, or after a murder, or whatever the fuck happened. When he was writing it, he still wanted to live his life.

DORIEN GARRY: There was a space and a time after he died when I almost forced myself to listen to him a lot at home, alone, trying to process. It was a little bit cathartic. But now it’s the opposite. I can’t even listen to it. I’ve been at a coffee shop a couple of times when it's come on and it’s a hard few minutes to get through. I hope that changes. I trust that it will. I think I’ll go through another wave of grief where I can listen to him and not feel like I miss him.

ROB SCHNAPF: There was a lot of crassness and a lot of disappointing behavior from people who were supposedly his friends. But the interesting thing is: This is how history is written. The ones who were there aren’t always the ones who speak. But if people are going to go back and use this as a reference, then it should be truthful.

He would have had a great career. He would be on his own right now. He’d be like Wilco, he’d be able to do whatever he wants. He wouldn’t need the business. He wouldn’t need it at all.

I don’t really listen to the records. Elliott still makes me sad, to be perfectly honest. I enjoy it in little bits, but I end up in this particular place, so.

JJ GONSON: When I decided I needed to shut off, I really shut him off. I never heard From the Bottom of the Hill, whatever it's called. I don't know his new songs. I really don't even listen to the old stuff.

LOU BARLOW:  There was an ATP show at the Queen Mary that he was meant to play, like less than three weeks after he died and his girlfriend [Jennifer Chiba] was like, "We're gonna have a show anyway. It's gonna be a tribute.” She approached me, like, "I want you to sing, because Elliott would've wanted you to sing." So I sang with his band and we did the set that he was meant to do. It was weird. I assumed I was terrible, because no one ever said anything about it, or maybe everybody was just freaked out. It was such a strange time.

AUTUMN DE WILDE: A bunch of us were tricked by journalists at the beginning, that’s why everyone’s pretty prickly about it. That was like an incredible breach of trust, and there was a great silence for a long time, from all of us.

But the loss of any friend takes a long time to heal. And then when you’re sharing that friend with people who didn’t know him—which is totally fine and amazing, because I would like everyone to know who he was, and I wish they could have sat with him—it's even weirder. When you tell people that you feel really sad about your grandma dying, they go, "Oh shit, I’m sorry." But when it’s someone famous, often you don’t say it, because immediately you worry: Does it seem like I’m name-dropping? So on top of trying to heal from losing a friend, you’re trying to manage all the bullshit in your head: What are my reasons for bringing this up right now? Is it to say that I knew him? Am I now that person crying in public so that they can say they knew him? Like, what the fuck?

LUKE WOOD: I have not spoken about Elliott since his death. I spoke to many people the week he passed, but that was about trying to express how gifted he was, trying to articulate my thoughts of him as an artist. I thought it was so important that what people remembered about Elliott was his work and not his death. My catharsis was on my own time.







New Moon (2007)

In 2007, Kill Rock Stars releases the rarities and B-sides compilation New Moon; overseen by Larry Crane, the album features liner notes by, among others, Sean Croghan and Rebecca Gates.


LARRY CRANE: Sam [Coomes] doesn't want to go on the record. Sean [Croghan] and I have been available, but we've been burnt by asshole journalists. With New Moon, I had to make a call that I was going to be available, because it was going to be of value. Maggie Vail dropped me a line when she was working at Kill Rock Stars. I knew that [Elliott’s father] Gary Smith was trying to get ahold of me. Initially, New Moon was going to be a bonus version of Either/Or, like an extra disc from that same era. But they decided that that was not necessary. 

I called Gary, and we talked about the latest idea, which was a larger, more comprehensive B-sides and rarities compilation. We discussed what it involved, and I wrote up a little proposal of how much it would cost, what I was going to do. I knew I had to go to L.A. and dig through the vaults where the tapes were stored and do some research. This really opened up the question of, "Shouldn't somebody archive this? We don't know what's on any of these reels until you hear them." And he said, "Would you like to do it?" I didn't expect that to be his response, but I thought, "Well gosh, I guess I could do that."

Luckily, I was able to contact Rob Schnapf, Tony Lash, Neil Gust, even Jon Brion, and all these different people and ask questions, which made a big difference. Initially, it was New Moon and then the archive job, but I wish I could have done it in the opposite order—I wish I could have done as much archiving I could do, and then pull New Moon out of what I found. It wouldn't be that different, but we have better tape transfers now. It would have sounded a little better. And maybe there were a few more songs that could've made it. But that's OK. It's a good record.

I used to go on that horrible Sweet Adeline [fan] forum when New Moon came out, and someone was mad that I put the drum tracking on a song. People had strong feelings because they heard rough mixes of these songs for years on cassette, where things were playing at the wrong speed, and they were giving me heat for offering the right version. [laughs] I just had to approach like, "I'm going to try to mix these similar to how he mixed the record." I wasn't trying to make judgments about if the song was really good or really bad, because they all seem pretty good to me.

AUTUMN DE WILDE: My relationship with that Figure 8 wall now is conflicted. Not because I have any grievances about it, but it was my wall that nobody cared about, you know? But I’m so glad because I love the Serge Gainsbourg wall—I don’t have any painful memories attached to the Serge Gainsbourg wall. So I tend to not get too close or read anything on it. It’s so awesome that people are repainting it, but it’s burned in my head—this mural from childhood—so I can't help but think that they painted it wrong. I don’t mean to sound like an asshole. I just mean they didn’t reproduce it exactly the same, so for me it’s like a weird blip, an awkward thing to look at because my eyes are trying to correct it.

LUKE WOOD: I've been fortunate to work with a lot of great artists in my career, but as a composer and a performer, Elliott was profoundly unique. The way he used harmonic structures. He could sit down to the piano and play Rachmaninoff. He could play almost any instrument. He could go from bluegrass to folk. He would go, literally, from Chopin to picking up the guitar and playing a Minutemen riff. When you have someone that's that deeply gifted and special, you're really just lucky to be in the room.

SCOTT BOOKER: I always said Either/Or is one of my top 10 albums of all time. The sad thing is I can’t listen to it anymore, it’s too hard. I'll put it on and my mind just starts thinking of things that I don’t want to think about while listening to a record I love. 

TONY LASH: For better or worse, there's a certain amount of locking Elliott away as I knew him.  There are obviously a lot of reasons to be sad about him passing, but one of the things that I found most sad was that the there was a lot of deterioration that happened. For the most part, people always have the capacity to change for the better. He had become distant from my life, and our relationship had fallen by the wayside, but I always felt like he was probably the single most talented musician that I ever worked with. Once we repaired our friendship, I thought there was always the potential we could do something again some day. When he died, that possibility was taken away, along with the possibility that he could find those really wonderful parts about himself again.

JJ GONSON: I didn't talk to anybody for like eight years. I couldn't do it. I just couldn't deal. The edge needed to wear off a little bit, because it was so raw. Elliott and I have mutual friends who talked a lot, right at the beginning. Now they're like, "I'm done, I never want to hear his name again." It's interesting. Recently, it's been kind of nice: People want to know, and I appreciate that as a music lover. Elliott was fantastic. He was a hilariously funny, super-fun person to be with, someone I absolutely adored with every microfiber of my body. It will always be a hard process, but I do feel some reconciliation in other people coming together.

Marissa Mayer cover with byline

On the morning of Thursday, July 12, 2012, Yahoo’s interim CEO, Ross Levinsohn, still believed he was going to be named permanent CEO of the company.

He had just one meeting to go.

That meeting was a board meeting, to be held that day in a room on the second floor of Yahoo’s Sunnyvale, Calif., headquarters. The room was big, with a large horseshoe table and video screens on the walls.

The agenda for the meeting: Levinsohn was going to brief the directors on his plan for Yahoo, should he be named permanent CEO.

Levinsohn walked into the room; all of his top executives followed.

There was Jim Heckman, Levinsohn’s top dealmaker, who’d spent months negotiating a huge deal with Microsoft. There was Shashi Seth, Yahoo’s top product management executive, already planning a long-needed update to Yahoo Mail and the Yahoo home page. There was chief financial officer Tim Morse, who’d just completed a critical, company-saving deal to sell a portion of Yahoo subsidiary Alibaba. There was Mickie Rosen, a News Corp. veteran whom Levinsohn had hired to run Yahoo’s media business. And there was Mollie Spillman, whom he’d just made CMO.

Heckman, Seth, Morse, Rosen, Spillman, and handful of others sat off to the side.

All of them believed that the meeting was a formality — that Levinsohn was going to get the job.

They had good reason to be confident. For the two months prior, the chairman of Yahoo’s board, Fred Amoroso, had made it clear that he was going to do everything he could to make sure Levinsohn and his team would be running the company for the foreseeable future.

Amoroso told Levinsohn this in private. He told Yahoo employees this during an all-hands meeting in May. He’d even joined a sales call to express support for Levinsohn to Yahoo advertisers — an oddly hands-on move for a chairman.

In June, Amoroso helped Levinsohn recruit a high-profile Google executive named Michael Barrett into Yahoo. During the recruiting process, Amoroso promised Barrett that Levinsohn’s “interim” title was only temporary — that it was safe to leave Google.

Levinsohn had another reason to be hopeful: For the past few months, he’d been speaking with two of Yahoo’s most important new directors, Dan Loeb and Michael Wolf, almost every day. As important as it was for Levinsohn to have Amoroso’s support, he needed Loeb’s more. Loeb ran a hedge fund called Third Point, which owned more than 5 percent of Yahoo and had, only months before, forced the resignation of Yahoo’s previous CEO. Wolf was an important ally for Levinsohn to have, too. Wolf, a former president of MTV, was consulting for Third Point on media investments when Loeb asked him to join the Yahoo board and lead its search committee for a new CEO.

Levinsohn began his presentation. It was going to be a doozy, as he planned to seriously alter the direction of Yahoo.

He wanted it to stop competing with technology businesses like Google and Microsoft and focus entirely on competing with media and content businesses like Disney, Time Warner, and News Corporation. As part of this transition, Levinsohn wanted to spin off, sell, or shut down several Yahoo business units. He said doing so would reduce Yahoo’s head count by as many as 10,000 employees, and increase its earnings before taxes and interest by as much as 50 percent.

In fact, Levinsohn announced during his presentation that he and his team had already started down this road.

Levinsohn told the board that, under his direction, Heckman had begun negotiating a deal with Microsoft to exchange Yahoo’s search business for Microsoft’s portal, MSN.com, and large payments in cash. Levinsohn and Heckman had also been talking with Google executive Henrique De Castro about turning over some of Yahoo’s advertising inventory. There was also talk of unloading some of Yahoo’s enterprise-facing advertising-technology businesses into a joint venture involving New York-based ad tech startup AppNexus.

Dan Loeb controlled 5 percent of Yahoo and joined the board after a bloody proxy fight.



It was during this part of his presentation that Levinsohn began to feel the permanent Yahoo CEO job slipping away.

Others in the room got the same sinking feeling.

Wolf, the man in charge of the committee tasked with hiring a permanent CEO, began to question the wisdom of the deal.

Wolf asked, in a loud voice with a sharp tone, “I understand why this is good for Microsoft, but why is it good for Yahoo?”

Harry Wilson, another director brought onto the board by Loeb, joined Wolf in his criticism of the deal as “short-sighted.”

Their cross-examination of the deal eventually boiled down to one question: Had Levinsohn and Heckman made any irreversible commitments to either Microsoft or Google?

It was obvious to several people in the room that Wolf and Wilson wanted to make sure another candidate for the CEO job would not be forced to follow through on a deal they had not negotiated.

This was a bad sign for Levinsohn’s candidacy.

But Wilson and Wolf’s loud complaints about the Microsoft deal weren’t the worst sign for Levinsohn’s chances; Loeb’s behavior during the meeting was.

Loeb is the suited, slick, and handsome Wall Street type. He wears his salt-and-pepper hair short and messy on purpose. He’s actually from Southern California, and sometimes he puts off a surfer vibe.

During Levinsohn’s presentation, Loeb looked bored. He wasn’t paying full attention. As the interim CEO talked, Loeb stood at the back of the room and played with his BlackBerry.

One person in the room remembers watching Loeb texting for a while and then, “during the most important part of the presentation,” getting up and going to the bathroom for 10 minutes.

This person remembers thinking: “Oh, OK. Sorry, Ross, you’re not CEO anymore.”

After the meeting, Barrett, the Google executive Amoroso had helped Levinsohn poach, called Levinsohn to ask how it went. Levinsohn told him he no longer felt like he was getting the job.

But who was?

That night, Levinsohn flew to Sun Valley, Idaho, where investment bank Allen & Co. holds an annual retreat for big-name media and technology executives.

Over the weekend, Levinsohn played a guessing game with venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Square CEO Jack Dorsey, and Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. With each of them, Levinsohn and the other Silicon Valley bigwigs ran through a long list of names, trying to figure out who might be getting the job Levinsohn had so hoped for. For each name they came up with, they came up with a persuasive reason why that person could not be it.

Whom had Wolf and Loeb so clearly already decided on?

Finally, late Sunday night, Levinsohn got a call from a friend of his at Google.

This person asked: Had Levinsohn heard that Marissa Mayer had interviewed for the Yahoo job the Wednesday prior?

Levinsohn realized everything all at once.

Levinsohn now knew who Yahoo’s next CEO would be.

Soon, so would everyone else.

On Monday, July 16, four days after Levinsohn’s last board meeting, Yahoo made it official: Thirty-seven-year-old Marissa Mayer was Yahoo’s new CEO.

The board had indeed already made Mayer an offer by the time Levinsohn went into that final meeting to present his plan for Yahoo.

After the news broke in public, Levinsohn admitted to friends that he was disappointed. He had really wanted the job, and believed he would have done very well with it. He also felt bad for the team he put in place, who would now have to report to an unfamiliar leader.

But Levinsohn was also at peace. If he had to lose out to someone, at least he lost out to an icon.

Marissa Mayer



There is no one else in the world like Marissa Mayer.

Now 38 years old, she is a wife, a mother, an engineer, and the CEO of a 30-billion-dollar company. She is a woman in an industry dominated by men. In a world where corporations are expected to serve shareholders before anyone else, she is obsessed with putting the customer experience first.

Worth at least $300 million, she isn’t afraid to show off her wealth. Steve Jobs may have lived in a small, suburban home with an apple tree out front, but Marissa Mayer lives in the penthouse of San Francisco’s Four Seasons Hotel.

While rival CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page of Google wear flip-flops, hoodies, and T-shirts, Mayer wears Oscar de la Renta on the red carpet.

Mayer calls herself a geek, but she doesn’t look the part. With her blonde hair, blue eyes, and glamorous style, she has Hollywood-actress good looks.

Young, powerful, rich, and brilliant, Mayer is a role model for millions of women. And yet, unlike Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, Mayer resists calling herself a feminist. She even infuriated working mothers across the world when she banned Yahoo employees from working from home.

Widely admired by the public at large, Mayer has many enemies within her industry. They say she is robotic, stuck up, and absurd in her obsession with detail. They say her obsession with the user experience masks a disdain for the money-making side of the technology industry.

There is some truth to what they say.

And yet, a year after Mayer took over Yahoo, the company’s stock price was up 100 percent. Engineers wanted to work for Yahoo again. More importantly, so did sought-after startup CEOs like Tumblr founder David Karp, who agreed to sell his company to Yahoo for $1.1 billion.

Questions persist

Most CEOs of Mayer’s stature — people running multibillion-dollar public companies the size of Yahoo — are gregarious, outgoing types — the kind of person who might have been a politician if the world of business and money hadn’t beckoned. Baby-kissers. Back-slappers. Schmoozers. Mayer is not that type. Peers from every stage of her life — from her early childhood days to her first year at Yahoo — say Mayer is a shy, socially awkward person.

How in the world has she overcome such a disadvantage to rise so far, so fast?

To a public casually interested in her career, Mayer’s career before Yahoo — spent entirely at Google — is remembered as one success after another. It wasn’t.

Mayer started off at Google spectacularly well, designing its home page, creating its product management structure, and becoming the face of the company. She became one of the most powerful people at one of the world’s most powerful companies.

But then, suddenly, her peers were promoted past her. Responsibility for the look and feel of Google’s entire suite of consumer-facing products, including the Google home page, was taken away from her. She was moved to a less important product: Google Maps. She was removed from a council of executives that met with Google’s CEO. To industry insiders, this sudden change was a demotion for Mayer. Was it actually? If it was, why did it happen? How did Mayer recover?

Mayer’s move to the top of Yahoo during the summer of 2012 was a shock for almost everyone — including the people who convinced her to do it. How did the board pull it off?

Then there’s the biggest question about Mayer: Can she save Yahoo?



Part 1_03 (1)

Marissa Ann Mayer was born May 30, 1975 to parents Margaret Mayer, a Finnish art teacher and homemaker, and Michael Mayer, an environmental engineer.

She grew up in Wausau, Wis., with a sports-playing brother, Mason Mayer. It was a middle-class upbringing. She went to public schools and worked a summer job as a grocery clerk, but her family had enough time and money to enroll her in countless activities.

Most press photos of Mayer today show her on a stage, speaking with an interviewer in front of a large crowd or a TV audience. She’s usually wearing a designer dress — probably from her favorite designer, Oscar de la Renta — and looking strong, confident, and in charge of the moment.

But Mayer, now 38 years old, wasn’t always so larger-than-life. She describes the child and teenage version of herself as “painfully shy.”

Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer at the 2013 Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference.

Indeed, the Mayer you see in photos today is not the one remembered by the peers she grew up with in the small town of Wausau. For one, her style involved more T-shirts, sweaters, and jeans — nice clothes, but nothing flashy. And while Mayer has always presented well in front of an audience, her peers don’t remember her as extroverted or larger-than-life.

One of those peers is named Brian Jojade. He took Advanced Math with Mayer in eighth grade. He remembers Mayer as someone who hated social attention. Once, Jojade called the local radio station and told them it was Mayer’s birthday. He asked the DJ to read her name out on air. Jojade, who had a small crush on Mayer, figured hearing her name would make her laugh. It didn’t. “She wasn’t amused at all. You could just tell it wasn’t fun for her.”

Otherwise, Jojade’s overriding memory of Mayer is as the “professional” girl who sat in the front of the classroom and “always worked hard and made sure no matter what she was going to do, it was going to get done right.”

Mayer’s Wausau West High School classmate Elize Bazter says she best remembers Mayer as the girl who was “kind to everyone” but would dodge conversations on her way to go study somewhere else.

Wausau West had a class schedule system where, instead of periods, the day was broken up into 20-minute “mods.” Classes lasted for 40 minutes or an hour. That meant there were 20-minute breaks during everyone’s day. Bazter said most upperclassmen would use the time to congregate in the school’s commons.

“You could study,” says Bazter, “but mostly it was talking and eating and gathering with your friends.”

Not for teenage Marissa Mayer.

“She would be the person to come down, get something to eat from the kitchen or the vending machines, and then she would go to the library or the science lab to study. She wouldn’t be the one to stay and sit there and converse for 20 minutes.”

Bazter says the image she thinks of when she remembers Mayer is of her “in school, books in hand, walking down the hallway to do something else.”

None of this is to say that Mayer had a sad, lonely time growing up in Wausau. She didn’t. Mayer is fond of Wausau.

When she got married to a San Francisco banker named Zachary Bogue in 2009, she held two ceremonies: One was in California, and a second at her childhood church, Immanuel Lutheran in Wausau.

As a kid, Mayer’s peers in school had no idea what to make of her. Likewise, Mayer says she was “painfully shy” around them. But teachers? Teachers were Mayer’s kind of people.

In 2010, Mayer returned to her hometown to be inducted into the Wausau School District’s “Alumni Hall of Fame.” At a luncheon held in honor of her and 25 teachers retiring that year, Mayer gave a speech that the school district recorded in a video.

In the video, Mayer stands at a podium in a blue designer dress with a yellow corsage pinned on. She begins the speech by thanking her teachers, “each of whom changed my life forever.”

Then she begins to list her teachers by name. As she does — “… Mr. Freedly, Mrs. Stay, Mr. Flanagan …” — you can see on Mayer’s face how important these people were to her growing up. About six names in, the timbre of Mayer’s voice actually breaks toward a sob, and she has to catch herself with a breath and a small gulp. She can’t stop her eyes from swelling with held-back tears, though.

Most teenagers fondly recall sneaking into high school their senior year for a prank — setting chickens loose or toilet-papering the hallways. Mayer once snuck into her AP Lit teacher’s classroom to decorate it like a jungle because she was so inspired by the teacher’s lesson on “Heart of Darkness.”

Mayer’s fifth-grade teacher at Stettin Elementary, Wayne Flanagan, remembers that Mayer refused to leave his classroom the last day of that school year. She did not want to go to middle school.

She told Flanagan she was worried that she wouldn’t make it there, with all the new kids and teachers she’d have to meet.

Flanagan says Mayer the little girl was “a home person; she liked to be safe and know where she’s at.”

Flanagan, who says it was obvious even then how far Mayer would go, told the reluctant little girl, “Oh, I think you’re going to make it fine.”

Still, she wouldn’t go. Eventually Flanagan called Mayer’s mother to let her know where her daughter was.

Certainly the people Mayer spent most of her childhood with were a particular kind of nurturing, mentoring adult: coaches, teachers, counselors, and instructors.

As a little kid, she was in Brownies. She took piano lessons. She played volleyball and basketball. She went to swimming and skiing lessons. She took ballet for as many as 35 hours a week during middle school and high school. Her mother says ballet taught her “criticism and discipline, poise and confidence.”

She was a “pompom” girl and a debater. She was on the precision dance team. A middle school classmate of Mayer's says she was on her high school curling team. (After this story was published, Mayer said she wasn't.)

Mayer was so busy in part because her mother, Margaret Mayer, pushed her to be.

Flanagan, the fifth-grade teacher, says Mayer’s mother would frequently stop by school to check on her daughter’s progress. He says he “got to be good friends” with the Mayers. “They were concerned about her and that she was making the right progress. And she was. And she knew that — that her parents were supportive of her.”

In one way, Mayer owes her career to the relationships she was able to form with teachers.

Statistics show that many high school girls do not feel like they belong in math or science classes. In 2003, 84 percent of high schoolers who took the SAT and said they wanted to major in computer science were boys — obviously that means just 16 percent were women.

Wausau West High School Yearbook

Mayer was on Wausau West's state championship winning debate team.

Mayer says she never felt that bias at Wausau West.

“It wasn’t until I was a professional woman mentoring other girls in math and science that I learned that openly liking math and science is unusual for girls. It’s actually considered far too nerdy and far too much for the boys.

“Wausau schools were so supportive that I never felt strange for a second about pursuing math and science and being good in them.”

Mayer credits her teachers for helping her become less shy.

They did this by showing Mayer that she could “organize” more than just her backpack, desk, and homework — that she could organize people, as their leader.

Mayer’s childhood piano teacher, Joanne Beckman, remembers Mayer being very different from other children in that she was someone who “watched people” in order to “figure out why they were doing what they were doing.”

“A lot of kids that age are very interested in themselves,” Beckman says, “She was looking at other people.”

By “looking” at her teachers, figuring out why they were doing what they were doing, Mayer overcame her “painful” shyness with peers by taking on the teacher’s role.

Even when she was in fifth grade, Mr. Flanagan could see the pedagogical side of Mayer developing. He thought she would become a teacher someday.

In high school, Mayer took a leadership position in every club she joined. She became president of the Spanish club, treasurer of Key Club, and captain of the debate team.

One of her closest friends from Wausau, Abigail Garvey Wilson, says, “When Marissa became captain of the pompom squad, she wasn’t in with that clique of girls, but she won them over in three ways.”

“First: sheer talent. Marissa could choreograph a great routine. Second: hard work. She scheduled practices lasting hours to make sure everyone was synchronized. And third: fairness. With Marissa in charge, the best dancers made the team.”

In 1993, Mayer applied to, and was accepted into, 10 schools, including Harvard, Yale, Duke, and Northwestern.

To decide which one she would go to, Mayer created a spreadsheet, weighing variables for each.

She picked Stanford. Her plan was to become a brain doctor — a profession that doesn’t draw much on the leadership traits Mayer was quickly developing.

But soon enough, Mayer would find herself once again overcoming her shyness by taking charge of a room full of peers, pushing them to work for hours.

Soon enough, she would find herself at the front of a Stanford classroom, interacting with people in the way that came most natural to her — teaching them.

Teaching was her calling.

The summer before Marissa Mayer went to Stanford, she began asking herself a question that would guide her through college and for the rest of her life.

What does Zune think?

That summer, Mayer attended the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia. It was nerd heaven. Picture science labs housed in wooden cabins shaded by trees. Mayer especially loved one experiment where they mixed water and cornstarch to make a sloppy goo-like substance that seemed to defy gravity.

One day, a postdoctoral student from Yale named Zune Nguyen spoke to the campers as a guest lecturer. He stunned all the smart kids in the room with puzzles and brainteasers. For days, the campers couldn’t stop talking about his talk.

Finally, one of Mayer’s counselors had enough.

“You know, you have it all wrong,” the counselor said to Mayer and the campers. “It’s not what Zune knows, it’s how Zune thinks.”

The counselor said that what made Nguyen so amazing wasn’t the facts that he knew, but rather how he approached the world and how he thought about problems. The counselor said the most remarkable thing about Nguyen was that you could put him in an entirely new environment or present him with an entirely new problem, and within a matter of minutes he would be asking the right questions and making the right observations.

From that moment on, the phrase: “It’s not what Zune knows, but how Zune thinks,” stuck with Mayer as a sort of personal guiding proverb.

In the fall, Mayer went to Stanford and began taking pre-med classes. She planned to become a doctor. But by the end of her freshman year, she was sick of it.

“I was just doing too many flashcards,” she says. “They were easy for me, but it was just a lot of memorization.”

She says she wanted to find a major “that really made me think” — that would train her to “think critically, and become a great problem-solver.” She also wanted to “study how people think, how they reason, how they express themselves.”

“I had this nagging voice in my head saying ‘It’s not what Zune knows, but how Zune thinks.’”

Mayer began to answer the voice in her head — and find a course of study that helped her learn how to think — when she took an introductory computer science class: CS105.

Mayer was engrossed by the challenge of programming — taking a problem and using her mind to solve it.

During the semester, she entered a classwide design contest for extra credit. Calling on the same part of her brain that made her such an excellent pompom choreographer, Mayer made a screen saver featuring exploding fireworks. In a class of 300, Mayer came in second.

The design was good enough that Mayer’s CS105 professor, Eric Roberts, would also use an adaptation of the screen saver as an assignment for the next several years.

Stanford professor Eric Roberts says Mayer was an incredible teacher.

Roberts was also impressed enough with Mayer’s exploding fireworks that he invited her and a few other top finishers over for dinner at his house. He became her mentor, as once again, Mayer bonded with a teacher.

Mayer had also found her major.

Mayer opted for symbolic systems — a combination of disciplines straight out of Zune Nguyen’s head: Linguistics, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and computer science classes.

Symbolic systems has become a famous Stanford major in Silicon Valley. Besides Mayer, other alumni include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman; former senior vice president of iOS software at Apple, Scott Forstall; and Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger.

Mayer’s teacherly leadership streak came out in a big way when she took Philosophy 160A, then considered a “weed-out course” for prospective symbolic systems majors.

During Philosophy 160A, the students break into study groups of a half dozen or so students, and the groups are assigned problem sets. Mayer’s group — just like all the others — put off doing their problem sets until the day before they were due.

So that semester at Stanford was full of all-nighters for Mayer and her Philosophy 160A group.

Mayer ended up in a group that included Josh Elman, now a venture capitalist. Looking back on those study sessions, Elman remembers “times when people in the group were bouncing off the walls.”

He says, “Marissa was always like, ‘OK, back to work. Let’s get this done.’ She was focused on making sure we got the right answer quickly.”

“It felt like she was the smartest student in the room — and the most serious. You always knew those two things about her. Very smart. Very serious.”

The social dynamic of the group was typical for Mayer. As usual, she commanded the room — organized the group’s work in an all-business fashion — but was otherwise shy, and somewhat reclusive.

In the years ahead, this combination — Mayer’s willingness to be authoritative and demanding the way a teacher would, with a “painful” fear or reluctance of being personal — would cause problems for Mayer.

One Stanford classmate interpreted Mayer’s shyness as being “kind of stuck up.”

“She would do her work and then leave. When other people would stay and hang out and have pizza, she’d just be out of there because the work is done.”

Indeed, Mayer doesn’t seem to have had a very active social life in college.

One person who lived in her dorm said she appeared to always be “down to business” and “not much for socializing.”

“She wasn’t one of those people into making new friends around the dorm. She was always doing something more important than just chilling.”

The simplest explanation for Mayer’s social behavior at Stanford remains that Mayer was, as she has said many times, “painfully shy.”

Later at Stanford, Mayer found herself in a group setting that was less social, more comfortable, and more familiar for her. As an upperclassman in symbolic systems, she was tapped to teach a class.

She took to it naturally.

Computer science professor Eric Roberts, still Mayer’s mentor, supervised her teaching. He says she was “unusually good at it” and “extremely effective.”

After Mayer taught a course in the spring, Roberts took a survey of her students. The results were astounding: They loved her — even if she did sometimes talk “a mile a minute.”

Roberts asked Mayer to stick around Stanford to teach another class over the summer; she readily agreed.

“She loved teaching,” says Roberts.

Of course she did. Stanford students called her “stuck up” when they were her classmates. But when she was their teacher, they thought she was great.

Mayer excelled the rest of her years as an undergraduate at Stanford. After she got her bachelor’s degree, she stayed at the school to get a master’s in computer science, with a speciality in artificial intelligence.

As graduate school drew to a close, word got out about Mayer’s teaching ability.

She soon faced a choice.

Should she become a teacher, and step full time into a role that had always suited her so well?

Or should she challenge herself and work somewhere in the technology industry?

Taking A 2 percent Chance On Google

When people ask Mayer why she joined Google after getting her masters in symbolic systems at Stanford, she likes to tell them her “Laura Beckman story.” It’s about the daughter of her middle school piano teacher, Joanne Beckman.

Mayer begins: “Laura tried out for the volleyball team her junior year at high school. At the end of the tryouts, she was given a hard choice: bench on varsity, or start on JV.

“Most people, when they’re faced with this choice, would choose to play - and they'll pick JV. Laura did the opposite. She chose varsity, and she benched the whole season.

“But then an amazing thing happened. Senior year she tried out and she made varsity as a starter, and all the JV starters from the previous year benched their whole senior year.

“I remember asking her: ‘How did you know to choose varsity?’

“And she said, ‘I just knew that if I got to practice with the better players every day, I would become a much better player, even if I didn’t get to play in any of the games.’”

The moral of Mayer’s story is that it’s always better to surround yourself with the best people so that they will challenge you and you will grow.

“My quest to find, and be surrounded by, smart people is what brought me to Google,” she says.

And that’s the overriding reason why Mayer joined Google. But quests for self-improvement aside, it’s also true that Mayer almost missed her chance to join the company that would make her rich and powerful someday.

Late on a Friday in mid-April of her last year at Stanford, Mayer sat at her computer, eating pasta and reading emails.

She already had 12 job offers to choose from, and wasn’t looking for any more hard choices.

So when yet another pitch from a recruiter popped up in her inbox, she tapped on her keyboard’s delete key to get rid of it.

Only, she missed.

Instead of hitting delete, Mayer hit the space bar and opened the email.

That email’s subject line: “Work at Google?”

Mayer read the email and remembered a conversation she had with Eric Roberts who was still a mentor years after she took his computer science class for non-majors. The prior fall, Roberts listened to Mayer talk about the recommendation engine she’d built, and then told her she should meet with a pair of Ph.D. students who were working on similar stuff. Their names: Sergey Brin and Larry Page.

Mayer realized that Google was their startup. Trusting Roberts' recommendation, she replied to an email she had meant to delete, writing that she’d like an interview.

She got one, and met with engineer Craig Silverstein. Silverstein blew her away with his smarts. In the Laura Beckman analogy, he was varsity.

Google offered Mayer a job. She seriously considered it.

Her reservations were that she had planned on taking a job at consulting firm McKinsey, where her clients would be Silicon Valley companies.

Google was a riskier career choice. In her typical, precise way, she’d crunched the data and had decided that the company only had a 2 percent chance of succeeding.

Also, some small part of Mayer was worried about Google’s weird name, which she imagined would be the punch line of family jokes for years to come.

She got over it.

“The turning point for me,” she says, “was realizing that I would learn more at Google, trying to build a company, regardless of whether we failed or succeeded, than I would at any of the other companies I had offers from.”

For the next 13 years, Marissa Mayer worked at Google.

Marissa Mayer joined Google as a programmer and rose to become the executive in charge of the way Google search and many other popular Google products looked to Web users.

She became a senior vice president, with thousands of Google employees reporting to her and hundreds of millions of people around the world using products she helped build. The job made her worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But then something strange happened to Mayer, and people in the industry wondered what went wrong.

Mayer during her early Google days.



Google in its early days was a fun place to work, energized by incredible success and perks like free food. But it was also a grinding, stressful environment.

On Mayer’s second day at Google in 1999, she went to the kitchen for a snack at around 11 A.M. There, she bumped into Larry Page, then CEO of the company. He was standing in a corner.

“I'm hiding,” he said. “The site is down. It’s all gone horribly awry.”

He was exaggerating, of course. Google was actually doing too well at the moment.

In 1999, Google.com was a cleaner-looking and faster search engine than any of the others on the Web, and it was rapidly taking share from older search engines like AltaVista and Lycos. In fact, the site was down that day because Google had just signed a deal with Netscape to handle search queries from Netscape.com. Google only had 300 computers serving search results, and it asked Netscape to send just a fraction of its traffic. Netscape ignored the request and sent all of its users.

Down went Google.com.

Google went back online that day, but only after hours of work from Mayer, Silverstein, and her new colleagues. She went home at 3 a.m.

Perhaps because of long nights like that one, Mayer and Page eventually grew very close. At one point during Mayer’s early years at Google, she and Page started dating.

Long hours would prove the norm for Mayer. During her first two years at Google, she worked 100 hours a week as a programmer.

Mayer thrived working the tough hours. She only needed four hours of sleep a night, and when she was awake, she would work harder than anyone. She found a niche at Google: guardian of the clean, easy-to-use look and feel of Google products. She obsessed over pixels; their hue, shade, and placement. She co-authored a handful of patents, including an important one for Google: “Graphical user interface for a universal search engine.”

By 2005, Mayer moved into management, overseeing the look and feel of Google’s most important products.

She was very good at it.

Google

Mayer in 2005.

During her first several years at Google, Mayer had been able to continue teaching at Stanford. She taught 3,000 undergraduates by the time she was promoted, so the part of managing that has to do with leading, teaching, and organizing came easy to her. She enjoyed working with younger Google employees so much that she even started teaching classes at Google.

She created a mentorship program called “APM” which stood for “associated product manager.” Each year Mayer would select junior Google employees for the APM program, give them assignments, and teach them classes. Then, at the end of the program, Mayer would take the entire APM “class” on a weeklong trip abroad to Google offices around the globe.

When it came to developing Google products, Mayer had a bigger challenge.

Mayer has never been someone who easily relates with others. That’s why people call her robotic or “stuck up.” This trait is why people sometimes walk out of meetings with her feeling deeply insulted by a perceived slight.

But being in charge of how Google products should look, Mayer’s job was, basically, to relate with Google’s millions of users. How would she do that?

In the end, it proved to be an advantage for Mayer that empathy doesn’t come naturally to her. It forced her to be intentional about figuring out what users want and how they behave.

She came up with two clever methods of relating.




Google Marissa Mayer
Mayer at the height of her power at Google.

The first is that she would recreate the technological circumstances of her users in her own life. Mayer went without broadband for years in her home, refusing to install it until it was also installed in the majority of American homes. She carried an iPhone at Google, which makes Android phones, because so did most mobile Web users.

Mayer’s second method was to lean on data. She would track, survey, and measure every user interaction with Google products, and then use that data to design and re-design.

Mayer’s design-by-numbers approach to product development was not always popular.

Famously, a lead designer named Doug Bowman quit Google over it.

In a farewell blog post, Bowman wrote: “… a team at Google couldn’t decide between two blues, so they’re testing 41 shades between each blue to see which one performs better. I had a recent debate over whether a border should be 3, 4 or 5 pixels wide, and was asked to prove my case. I can’t operate in an environment like that. I’ve grown tired of debating such minuscule design decisions. There are more exciting design problems in this world to tackle.”

Bowman went to Twitter.

Mayer’s obsession with data-driven design would only gain more and louder critics over the years. But Mayer’s methods also made her one of the Internet’s most effective design and product development leaders during her years at Google. People at Google credit her with the success of not just Google search, but also many others, including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google News.

Google co-founder Sergey Brin says: “Marissa makes the decisions she feels are right, and history proves that she probably calls it right.”




Marissa Mayer in San Francisco Magazine
San Francisco Magazine

Julian Guthrie profiled Marissa Mayer in San Francisco Magazine's March 2008 issue.

Fame and Glory
As Google became a world-famous company, Mayer began to get attention from the media. Newsweek called her one of the “10 Tech Leaders of the Future.” Business 2.0 named her to the “Silicon Valley Dream Team.” Now-defunct technology news site Red Herring said Mayer was one of “15 Women to Watch.”

Then, in 2004, Google went public. Its stock price soared. This made Mayer and hundreds of her colleagues rich in an instant. The media’s fascination with Google kicked up several notches. Mayer, in charge of the look of Google’s most important product, and a rare photogenic woman in the technology industry, was a natural subject of the media’s fixation.

Mayer also boosted her public profile by deciding to spend her new riches conspicuously. She bought the $5 million penthouse suite at the Four Seasons in San Francisco, and another home closer to Google’s Mountain View campus. She started throwing fabulous parties at both, jumping feet first into San Francisco’s high-end social scene. Guests at her homes would see expensive original artwork from famous artists, like the 400-piece glass installation Mayer commissioned from Dale Chihuly.

Mayer did not mind the attention. In fact, she asked Google public relations staff to get her more of it, but in the right outlets.

Mayer’s eagerness to be known by the public may appear to contradict her claim that she suffers from shyness. It doesn’t. She describes her shyness as a need to withdraw from social situations almost as soon as she enters them. Being featured in a glossy magazine does not require her to interact with every reader, so she probably doesn’t have as much anxiety about it as she does making small talk at a party.

Plus, there is such a thing as overcompensation.




Marissa Mayer in Vogue
Mayer in Vogue in 2009

By the end of the decade, Vogue magazine would profile Mayer, and describe her as “the 34-year-old mega-millionaire, Oscar de la Renta-obsessed, computer-programming Google executive who lives in a penthouse atop the Four Seasons.”

Outside Google, her star was never brighter. Inside Google, however, where wealth was supposed to be quietly spent, and engineers were supposed to rule, Mayer would soon be under siege.

Demoted

At the end of 2010 and beginning of 2011, Marissa Mayer’s remarkable career suddenly lost momentum.

First, in Oct. 2010, Mayer was removed from the top of Google’s search organization and put in charge of Google Maps and other “local” products.

Technically, this was a lateral move, if not a promotion, because Mayer retained her vice president title and she was, at the same time, given a seat on Google’s Operating Committee — then CEO Eric Schmidt’s roundtable of top executives from the company.

In reality, it was a demotion. Mayer was no longer in charge of what Google’s most important product looked like or how it worked. At Google, there is search, which generates nearly all of the company’s revenues and profits, and then there is everything else. Running Google search, Mayer was managing the most important product at the world’s most important Internet company. Running Google Maps, she was not.

Still, there was the mitigating factor that Mayer was on Google’s Operating Committee, and she therefore reported directly to CEO Eric Schmidt.

That went away too.



Larry Page
By Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Google CEO Larry Page did not put Mayer on his executive team.

In December 2010, co-founder Larry Page announced that a decade after giving the CEO job up to Eric Schmidt, he was going to take it back.

When Page formally took control of Google in April 2011, he dissolved the Operating Committee and created a new council of executives who would report directly to him. This group came to be known as the “L-Team.” Mayer was not named to it.

Then, to make matters worse for Mayer, Page put another Google executive, Jeff Huber, in charge of “Geo/Local,” the group Mayer had been tasked to run only months before. Mayer now reported to Huber, who joined Google in 2003 — four years after her.

Mayer’s loss of authority was felt across the company. One former colleague says that prior to 2010, Mayer was always able to “get what she needed” from management.

“If her boss [Google senior vice president of product] Jonathan Rosenberg didn’t approve of something — didn’t give her head count or didn’t give her an acquisition or whatever — she’d just go right above him and get what she needed.”

That now stopped.

“She would try to do something and HR would say that’s not the kind of thing she could do anymore.”

“That whole paradigm broke apart.”

Another former colleague says, “When I first turned up, Marissa was very powerful at Google. Marissa used to issue edicts and everyone did them. Over time that proved not to be so true.”

Another way to track the rise and fall of Mayer at Google is to look at the company’s own, public list of executives in the “About Google” section of Google.com.

In November 2005, Mayer’s name and bio finally appeared on Google’s management page. By May 2011, her name was off the site.

What happened to Marissa Mayer’s career?

One explanation is that Mayer’s career stalled as 2010 ended and 2011 began because that is exactly when Larry Page decided he was going to become Google CEO again.

Because Mayer and Page had dated years before, some wonder if Page decided he could never allow Mayer to report directly to him because it would be unethical or show favoritism.

Everyone at Google had long known about the relationship, and no one ever made it an issue — it was too taboo to bring up.

One Googler explains: “Google is one of those places where, like a cult, there are things that are OK to talk about and things that are not OK to talk about. That was one of those things that was not OK to talk about.”

It’s actually hard to find someone at Google who was bothered by the fact that there once was a romantic relationship between Mayer and Page.

Perhaps this is because both of them have so publicly moved on.

Mayer and her husband, Zachary Bogue

In 2007, Page married a Stanford graduate student named Lucy Southworth. The ceremony was on Richard Branson’s private island.

That same year, a Google colleague emailed Mayer to say: “I’m bringing a boy I think you’d be interested in. Be cool.” The “boy” was Zachary Bogue. Tall and dark-haired, Bogue looks like he could be the star of “The Bachelor.” He had played football at Harvard, and was now a banker in San Francisco. In 2009, Mayer and Bogue married. Vogue covered the ceremony. Of their married life, he says: “We continue to do work in the evening. There’s never a distinct line between work and home. Marissa’s work is such a natural extension of her. It’s not something she needs to shed at the end of the day.”

It’s possible that Mayer’s romantic history with Page stalled her career at Google. But that’s not a widely held belief among Mayer’s former colleagues.

A more common explanation was that she may not have had the right kind of ambition to go much further.

There’s a philosophy that corporations exist to benefit three constituencies: shareholders, employees, and customers. At Google, there are two kinds of customers: the users of Google’s services and the advertisers who pay Google to be seen by users.

Mayer spent all her years at Google worried about just half of one of those constituencies: users.

To be fair, that was her job.

From Google’s earliest days, Mayer had always been tasked with making products that users love. And she pursued this task with a single-minded passion, sleeping four hours a night, working 100-hour weeks, grinding through back-to-back meetings without breaks.

But Mayer may have been a bit too single-minded in this pursuit — at least for the sake of her future at Google.

Compared to some Google executives who joined the company around the same time as Mayer, Mayer showed much less interest in learning about the business side of the company.

One former Google executive who worked in ad sales says, “I did not work with her, and that’s telling.”

This executive says that even before Mayer joined Google’s Operating Committee, she had an open invitation to join its meetings — out of respect for her importance to the company and in an effort to develop her career. But while Mayer would always show up for meetings about Google’s products, “she would never show up for a business review.”

By contrast, two of Mayer’s peers — Susan Wojcicki and Jeff Huber — “would make the time and be there because they were interested in expanding their horizons.”

By 2010, when Mayer’s Google career started stalling, Wojcicki and Huber were getting promotions. Both would end up reporting directly to Larry Page. Huber would become Mayer’s boss. Today, Wojcicki is considered one of the two or three most powerful executives at Google.

Mayer missed several of these types of opportunities. In the months before he became CEO again, Larry Page would hold two-hour, post-Operating Committee meetings on Mondays that were more focused on long-term strategy.

One executive who was flattered to be invited says, “I was pretty interested in understanding the connection between Chrome and Android.”

But Mayer would hardly ever show, “either because she was traveling or who knows.”

Several of the regular attendees at those meetings ended up with positions reporting directly to Page.

One of them was Sundar Pichai, now leading development of both Google’s Chrome and Android products. Pichai’s ascent had to be bittersweet to Mayer. He used to work for her, and she had promoted him. Now he was passing her by.




Google Chrome VP Sundar Pichai
Matt Rosoff

Sundar Pichai

But a former colleague says Pichai was a perfect contrast to Mayer when it came to being involved with Google as a whole.

“Sundar would do anything to help the company. He was internally working cross-functionally to get results. If someone was offline and didn’t get the strategy he’d sit down with them one-on-one. He really put work into it. Marissa didn’t do that at all.”

One of Mayer’s former colleagues says she skipped all those meetings because, when it came to the business side of Google, Mayer was always “less interested.”

“She has a disposition toward the consumer side, and users.”

This trait undoubtedly shaped Mayer’s career at Google, and it would be very important later at Yahoo.

But more than her lack of interest in the business side of Google, and certainly more than her history with Page, there was one overriding reason for Marissa Mayer’s sudden decline in power.

Her great strength, her teacherly I-know-best leadership style had finally begun to grate on people at Google. Worse, it had begun to slow the company down.

Eventually, a group of Google engineers decided to try and do something about it.

John Battelle, who has put on several large tech conferences in the Bay Area, many of them featuring Marissa Mayer as a speaker, says of her: “I've never had a conversation with her when she wasn’t completely certain she was right.”

This pedantic style works when you are the traffic cop in a room full of designers and product managers, but it alienated some of Mayer’s colleagues over the years.




salar kamangar
http://ashleyannphotography.com

Mayer and and Salar Kamangar clashed often.

One peer it irked in particular was Salar Kamangar. Now the CEO of Google-owned YouTube, Kamangar joined Google as its ninth employee. He drafted its original business plan, and handled financing and legal early on. Younger than Mayer, he rose along with her at Google, though not as conspicuously.

Mayer and Kamangar clashed often.

The specific habit of Mayer’s that drove Kamangar nuts was her ability to speak incredibly fast, not allowing him to re-enter the debate.

“In an academic situation, that’s OK because the best ideas rise and you have discussion,” says one Googler, familiar with Kamangar’s complaints about Mayer. “But in a place where there are personal feelings involved, if you can’t win the debate regardless of how hard you try, because she will out-talk you, that’s a challenging situation.”

The rivalry between Mayer and Kamangar was so intense that when Kamangar was made a vice president before her, she threatened to quit the company. She got her promotion months later.

Another Mayer habit that annoyed colleagues was one she picked up straight from academia.

For many years at Google, Mayer insisted that if her colleagues wanted to speak with her, they had to do so during her “office hours.” Mayer would post a spreadsheet online, and ask that anyone who wanted to speak with her sign up for a five-minute window.

When Mayer’s “office hours” rolled around in the afternoon, a line would start to form outside of her office and spill over into the nearby couches.

“Office hours” are socially acceptable in an academic environment because the power dynamic is clear. The students are subordinate to the professor, usually their elder and mentor.

But Mayer’s office hours were not just for her subordinates, but also her peers.

So there, amid the associate product managers waiting to visit with Mayer to discuss their latest assignment or a class trip to Zurich, sat Google vice presidents — people who had been at the company as long as Mayer, and in some cases held jobs as important as hers.

What made the “office hours” even more obnoxious for some Google engineers and product managers was that all consumer-facing product launches or updates required Mayer’s sign-off.

“Her weakness was an unwillingness to delegate,” says Craig Silverstein, the Google engineer who hired Mayer years ago. “She doesn’t need any sleep. When you have four or five more hours in the day than most people do, you don’t learn to delegate because you don’t need to.”

The team who grew most frustrated with Mayer over the “office hours” and, more generally, the need for her to sign off on product changes, were the engineers in charge of Google search.



Amit Singhal of Google
sigir2006

One story is that Amit Singhal told Larry Page that Mayer had to go.

Several of Mayer’s former Google colleagues confirm that among the most put off was Amit Singhal.

While Mayer was in charge of the way Google Search looked, Singhal, was one of the engineers in charge of creating the algorithms that actually power the search engine. After he re-wrote Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s original code in 2001, he was named a “Google Fellow.” He’s a big deal inside the company.

One of Mayer’s former Google colleagues says that it was actually Singhal and three other search engineers who finally went to Larry Page and asked that Mayer be removed from the top of Google’s search organization.

“These four guys, they were constantly being hampered. They’d say: ‘We want to roll out this ranking change.’ Marissa’s like, ‘until I review it, you can’t launch it.’ They’re like: ‘But it’s been three weeks.’”

Finally, says this source, Singhal and the other engineers went to Larry Page and said, “Take your pick. Her, or us.”

In this person’s telling, Page made his choice and that’s why Mayer was moved out of search. She had become a bottleneck.

Other people say Page removed Mayer from her perch atop search after lots of input from lots of people.

Says one Googler: “What Larry saw as he became CEO was that Marissa has a tough user-interface that causes problems with other stakeholders.”

Another Googler familiar with those discussions says: “Everyone agreed that something needed to change.”

This Googler wonders if Mayer was unfairly punished in 2010 and 2011.

“Sometimes she got into trouble because she’s ambitious and a woman and that’s tough in a man’s world. People take potshots at her because she was very young and successful. I also think she’s young and learning and you sometimes don’t get things right.”

Another reason for Mayer’s career stall in 2011 was that Google, as a company, had grown up.

By 2010, Google had 24,000 employees. It wasn’t going to be the kind of place where, just because an executive had been there a long time and knew the co-founders personally, she was going to be able to get whatever she wanted.

“You couldn’t run the company like that anymore,” says one person who lived through the transition.

“As you grow you have to hire people who have done this stuff before, and having people who haven’t lord over them doesn’t work.”

So, by early 2011, Marissa Mayer’s progress at Google had stalled. But another, greater opportunity was about to come her way.

On the afternoon of Monday, July 16, 2012, Yahoo chief revenue officer Michael Barrett stood at a gate in New York’s JFK airport, waiting to board a plane to London.




AdMeld CEO Michael Barrett
AdMeld

Michael Barrett had only joined Yahoo weeks before Mayer.

Suddenly, his phone rang. It was a reporter. She said, “Oh my God. You have a new boss. What do you think?”

The reporter told Barrett the news: Yahoo had a new CEO. It was Marissa Mayer from Google.

Barrett was shocked.

Barrett himself had only joined Yahoo from Google less than a month before.

Barrett’s job at Google had been a good one. He’d only left because Yahoo chairman Fred Amoroso had told him that interim CEO Ross Levinsohn was going to get the full-time job.

As Barrett got back off the plane, he thought: What the hell happened?

- - -

The story of how Marissa Mayer came to Yahoo begins in the summer of 2011.

That’s when Dan Loeb, the manager of a hedge fund called Third Point, decided he could make a lot of money investing in Yahoo if he could force a few people to quit its board and install a CEO of his choosing.

There were two simple reasons Loeb believed Yahoo was a worthwhile investment, despite a decade of mismanagement. The first was that 700 million or so people still went to Yahoo.com every month, even though the company hadn’t come up with a cool new product in years.

The second was that Yahoo had made a brilliant investment in two Asian Internet companies, Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan, and Loeb did not believe this investment was being taken advantage of by management.

So Loeb took a 5 percent stake in Yahoo and began a letter-writing, shareholder-activist campaign to unseat its CEO and several of its board members. In his letters, Loeb accurately pointed out that Yahoo had been mismanaged for a decade, and that it was largely the board’s fault. In December, Yahoo’s board hoped to appease Loeb by hiring PayPal president Scott Thompson to be Yahoo’s new CEO.

Loeb was not appeased. Publicly, he began lobbying Thompson to install new board members. Privately, Loeb asked a consultant he’d hired, former MTV president Michael Wolf, to begin looking for someone who could replace Thompson.



Michael Wolf by David Needleman
David Needleman

Dan Loeb asked Michael Wolf to find a CEO for Yahoo.

With this mission in mind, Loeb and Wolf flew to San Francisco for a series of meetings in January 2012.

One morning during their trip, Loeb and Wolf drove south to meet with venture capitalist Marc Andreessen for breakfast at his house. Famous for co-founding Netscape, the original Web browser company, Andreessen had gone on to found two other billion-dollar companies and a successful venture capital firm. By the winter of 2012, Andreessen had become Silicon Valley’s go-to wise man.

Loeb and Wolf asked Andreessen if he’d join their slate for Yahoo’s board. He refused to participate in a deal perceived to be hostile to Yahoo’s founders and current management, but said he was happy to talk about Yahoo strategy.

The New Yorkers asked him: Whom should Yahoo hire: a media person or a product person?

By a “media person,” they meant an executive who could run Yahoo almost like a television network or magazine publisher, but on the Internet. This person’s specialties would be the ability to identify great content, close deals with the people who create it and those who could distribute it, and the skill set to sell ads against it. CBS chief executive Les Moonves and former News Corp chief operating officer Peter Chernin are this kind of executive. So was Michael Eisner when he spent 20 years transforming Disney from a sleepy studio into a corporate giant.

By a “product person,” Loeb and Wolf meant someone who could get teams of engineers and designers to build software tools that consumers find useful, addictive, or fun. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is this kind of executive. So was Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs.

Almost since its beginning, Yahoo had struggled with its identity.

Should it act like a “media” company — one that tries to attract consumers by producing and buying content and distributing it through Yahoo.com? Or should Yahoo act like a “products” company — where Internet software tools like search, Webmail, stock charts, and photo storage attract users?



Marc Andreessen
AP

Marc Andreessen

Andreessen said: If you get the chance to run Yahoo, the only way you'll be able to save it is if you hire someone who can make great Yahoo products.

Andreessen talked about the difference between technology companies and “normal” companies. He said the output of normal companies is their product: cars, shoes, life insurance. In his view, the output of technologies companies is innovation. Whatever they are selling today, they will be selling something different in five years. If they stop innovating, they die.

Andreessen said the person at the top of Yahoo needs to know how to pioneer and produce a steady stream of innovative products if the company was going to survive in a competition with large companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple or even some of the Valley’s many startups.

The message stuck.

In May 2012, Loeb finally figured out a way to get Scott Thompson out of the CEO job.

Loeb learned that Thompson had graduated from Stonehill College in 1979 with a bachelor’s degree in accounting — not a “bachelor’s degree in accounting and computer science” as Yahoo claimed on its website, and more importantly, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from April.

On May 3, Loeb drafted a letter containing this information, and sent it to the Yahoo board and the SEC, which would publish it for the public. On May 13, Thompson resigned, citing health issues.

Scott Thompson resigned from Yahoo after Dan Loeb revealed his bio was false.

The Yahoo board, which had hired Thompson without the help of an outside executive search firm, also capitulated. In a legal settlement, it gave Loeb much of what he’d been asking for since the summer before.

Five directors resigned immediately. Loeb and Wolf gained board seats, and more importantly, the chairmanship of two important committees. Loeb would chair the board’s transaction committee, which meant he would have sign-off power on any sale of Yahoo’s valuable Asian assets. Wolf would lead the executive search committee, which had the immediate task of finding Yahoo’s next CEO.

Wolf had someone in mind — just the kind of “products” CEO Andreessen had recommended. He hired executive recruiter Jim Citrin of Spencer Stuart, and gave him a description of the Yahoo CEO job.

The document Wolf gave Citrin said Yahoo needed to hire someone who can “modernize” Yahoo’s “user experiences” on mobile devices by building a culture that attracts the best “content, developer, product innovation, advertising, marketing and managerial talent.” The document said the board sought someone who could “re-establish Yahoo!’s credibility and reputation in the tech-innovator community” and build partnerships with companies such as “Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon.”

At Citrin’s first meeting with the board the week of May 21, 2012, he told the directors there were only a few people in the industry who could do the job described in Wolf’s document. Citrin said those people were at companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google. He said that it was going to be very difficult for Yahoo to hire any of them.

The board came up with a list of candidates for Citrin to approach.

Though he was a “media,” not a “products” executive, the top prospect for most of the directors was Ross Levinsohn, who became interim Yahoo CEO when Thompson stepped down.

Levinsohn, who worked in Yahoo’s Santa Monica office, is the kind of executive who looks like he belongs in the CEO’s office of a west coast entertainment company. He'll point at the camera when he’s having his picture taken. He’s got a wide smile. His hair is combed back. He wears suits. He looks good in the fleece zip-up sweater vests they give out at Allen & Co’s Sun Valley conference for media moguls.

Levinsohn joined Yahoo in October 2010 as an executive vice president in charge of the “Americas” region. Levinsohn had impressed shareholders with his performance at Yahoo’s annual shareholder meeting in 2011, when he presented a vision for Yahoo as “the world’s premier digital media company.” For a moment, he’d ended the confusion about what kind of company Yahoo was — a “product” company or a “media” company. To many directors, it seemed like Levinsohn understood the value of Yahoo’s audience, and had a plan to tap it.



Eddy Cue Apple

Apple's Eddy Cue was a candidate for the Yahoo CEO job.

Among the other names were Nikesh Arora, the chief business officer at Google; Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services; and Jason Kilar, then the CEO of Web TV site Hulu.

The board also asked Citrin to approach Google’s Marissa Mayer.

Citrin cautioned that Mayer appeared to be a lifer at Google and was unlikely to be interested in the job.

Many of the directors wondered whether Mayer was actually capable of leading a large public corporation. They asked question like: Had she ever managed a balance sheet? Hadn’t she been demoted only a year before?

Citrin said he’d call Mayer anyway.

In the middle of June 2012, Marissa Mayer sat on a plane, thinking and preparing. That Monday, she’d gotten a call from Jim Citrin of executive search firm Spencer Stuart. He’d been retained by Yahoo, and he had Yahoo director Michael Wolf with him.

Would she like to speak to Wolf? She would.

Now Mayer was flying to New York to have dinner at Wolf’s Manhattan apartment with Wolf, Citrin, and three other Yahoo directors: David Kenny, John Hayes, and Thomas McInerney.

After 13 years at Google, she was surprised to find herself actually, finally, truly considering leaving.

The past two years at Google — since she was, according to the rest of the world “demoted” — had been quieter than the first 11, but in many ways more challenging and exciting.

In local and geo, she’d taken over a much more massive operation than the one she’d been running at Google.

Whenever people asked her about the “demotion,” as Wolf and the other directors might over dinner, Mayer always pointed out how she had gone from managing 250 product managers in search to supervising a much larger, more diverse group of managers — 1,100 people managing engineering, design, marketing, and sales. Mayer would tell people that she was supervising some 6,000 contractors.

She’d figured out that by the fraction of the company, the geo and local piece that she was running was something like 20-25 percent of the company’s overall headcount.

The business challenges she’d dealt with in those years had been as diverse as the types of people she managed.

In September 2011, she went and bought Zagat for $125 million. It was not the kind of deal someone who had been “demoted” could do. It was Google’s 10th-largest acquisition ever. More than that, the integration of Zagat into Google search signaled a major change in Google’s philosophy.

Previously, the company had steadfastly refused to own or produce content that would show up in its search engine. It would just index what was already out there being created by the rest of the world.

But after Mayer joined geo in 2010, she found that the “rest of the world” wasn’t as good at gathering geographic data and putting it on the Web as it was creating websites for Google to index. So she decided it was time for Google to start owning data. Her boss, Jeff Huber, and Larry Page had backed her on the deal and the philosophical change, and now Google had lots of content for location-based searches — a popular kind of search to do on mobile, which was quickly becoming the future of the Internet.

Even as Mayer was on the plane, she was playing a crucial part in helping Google fend off one of its toughest competitors in mobile: Apple. Months before, she’d noticed that Apple had started buying companies in the mapping space. Then executive recruiters sent by Apple had started reaching out to her people.

Obviously, they were up to something big. Mayer didn’t know — Apple would never announce it until it was done — but she figured it planned to remove Google Maps from the iPhone and replace it with its own Apple Maps. She’d already countered Apple’s offers by giving her people what they really wanted. Sometimes it was raises. Sometimes it was independence. Sometimes it was new titles. Sometimes it was actually more work, more responsibility. She knew what her people wanted. None of her reports ended up quitting to join Apple. Now, Mayer had her team working on a new Google Maps app for iPhone. She was confident it was going to beat anything Apple’s people could come up with.

Mayer knew that her job switch in 2010 looked like a demotion to some people outside the company — especially people in the media. But as she flew to New York that day in June 2012, Marissa Mayer knew that she’d spent the previous two years learning a lot from a bigger job than she’d ever had before.

And now she knew that she was ready for an even bigger one.

On the evening of June 24, Mayer arrived at Wolf’s modern, Fifth Avenue apartment. An informal dinner was served.

Mayer read for the part of Yahoo CEO.

Throughout the conversation, Mayer touted a surprisingly thought-out plan for overhauling Yahoo’s culture, executive suite, and product line-up.

After Mayer left, one of the board directors said to Citrin: “That’s the next CEO of Yahoo.” The committee agreed that Wolf would stay in touch with her.

One of the directors noticed something funny, but decided to keep it to himself. Wolf had served a very expensive bottle of wine, and Mayer hadn’t had a sip. Probably she was just nervous.

Wolf wants to hire Mayer, but everyone else?

After that dinner, Wolf, the chair of Yahoo’s search committee, had decided that Marissa Mayer should be the next CEO of Yahoo.

With her experience running cornerstone Google products like Search, Google Maps, and Gmail, she was exactly the kind of innovative, products-oriented CEO that Silicon Valley wise man Marc Andreessen had told him to hire back in January.

But Wolf, and his pro-Mayer allies on the board, had a problem.

By mid-June, other Yahoo directors had already all but decided that interim CEO Ross Levinsohn should get the full-time job.

When Thompson resigned in the middle of May, and Levinsohn was named interim CEO, new chairman Fred Amoroso pulled Levinsohn aside and told him to run Yahoo like he was going to be the full-time CEO. After that conversation, Levinsohn sent a memo to all of Yahoo’s employees. He wrote, “I’m fired up and I hope you are too. I believe in the power of what we’re doing. We have an incredibly talented team, unparalleled strengths in key areas and most importantly, I see the purple pride building everywhere. Let’s move forward quickly with conviction and confidence.”

Levinsohn ran with the opportunity, and by the end of June — really, just a few weeks — he’d accomplished a lot. He’d signed a deal with Facebook over patents. He was able to quickly recruit impressive executives into Yahoo, including Google advertising executive Michael Barrett. Levinsohn and his top dealmaker, Jim Heckman, were also able to nail down several content partnerships in just a few weeks, including one with on-demand music service Spotify. Levinsohn and Heckman were also busy working on much larger deals with Microsoft, Google, and a fast-growing ad tech company based in New York called AppNexus.

As Levinsohn worked hard to earn the full-time job, Yahoo directors began to come under pressure from the rest of the industry to hand him the job. Levinsohn’s allies across the media, advertising, and entertainment industries wrote Yahoo directors letters recommending him.

LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner and cofounder Reid Hoffman lobbied for Ross Levinsohn.

At The Wall Street Journal’s D: All Things Digital conference, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner and LinkedIn co-founder and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman enthusiastically endorsed Levinsohn, and said Yahoo would finally be in good hands if it put him in charge.

After several weeks went by without Yahoo naming a full-time replacement for Thompson, even Marc Andreessen wrote a note to Loeb suggesting that Yahoo should just put Levinsohn in the job permanently and commit to a media strategy, since it seemed unlikely they could get a top-end product CEO, and continued delays would permanently damage the company.

Meanwhile, All Things D reporter Kara Swisher — who had, over the years, covered Yahoo closer than anyone thanks to board-level sources — seemed to be actively pushing for Yahoo to hire Levinsohn. She said the only reason the board hadn’t hired him yet was that it was looking for a “unicorn CEO — one who actually does not exist but who sounds just dreamy.”

By the beginning of July, several board members were almost completely sold. They wanted Levinsohn to keep the job.

The top secret interviews

The Four Seasons in Palo Alto

On the morning of Wednesday, July 11, 2012, a small bus pulled in front of the Four Seasons Hotel in East Palo Alto, California; a squat all-glass building in the middle of a parking lot next to a highway. As the bus idled, about a dozen middle-aged executives quietly boarded.

These executives were the Yahoo board of directors, and as they boarded that bus, they had no idea where they were going. Their destination was a secret because these people — people who would soon have to come together and decide the fate of Yahoo — did not trust each other.

That day, the board was going to interview, for the last time, four finalist candidates for the Yahoo CEO job.

The search committee had decided that if the entire board knew where the final interviews were taking place, one of the directors would inevitably leak the location to All Things D reporter Kara Swisher. For years, the aviators-wearing, tough-talking Swisher had been reporting Yahoo layoffs, firings, hirings, and acquisitions before they actually happened. The new directors assumed she had a source, or sources, on the old board, and they were determined not to provide her new ones.

Six days before, Swisher had reported, accurately, that the board was considering Hulu CEO Jason Kilar for the job. The report had made things awkward for Kilar with Hulu’s corporate parents, Disney and News Corporation, and he’d pulled himself out of the running — taking a good option away from the board. Some members of the board felt Swisher had meant to nuke Kilar in order to help Levinsohn get the job. (Swisher denies this, and there isn't any evidence to back the allegation.)

David Kenny was particularly insistent on secrecy. The fall prior, before Scott Thompson was hired, Kenny had interviewed for the CEO job at Yahoo. Word of his meetings in Sunnyvale had gotten out, and Kenny had to resign from Akamai, where he was president. Kenny recovered nicely — he’d become the CEO of The Weather Channel — but he didn’t want the same thing happening to any of the executives interviewing that day.

The directors rode in the bus for exactly five miles — south on University, south on 101, off the highway at Oregon Expressway, and continuing onto Page Mill road.

This is the secret location of the Yahoo CEO interviews

After 10 to 15 minutes, the the bus pulled into an office park, and everyone got out.

They’d arrived at the offices of Third Point’s law firm, Gibson Dunn. The location was ostensibly picked by headhunter Jim Citrin, who’d also arranged the buses. But some of the directors took it as a signal from the Third Point board members about whose show this really was.

Citrin had also arranged for a car to pick up Levinsohn. He had no idea where he was going, either. He also didn’t know who the other finalists were.

Levinsohn went first. He presented his plan, which the board was familiar with by then. He wanted to get Yahoo out of the “platform” business, where it was competing with Google, Microsoft, and Facebook — and move it into the content business. Levinsohn knew some of the directors were worried that he’d ignore Yahoo’s engineers and product development people, so he talked about how he’d been spending a lot of time with product boss Shashi Seth and his team.

The interview felt strange to Levinsohn. He’d been talking to Loeb a handful of times, every day. He said, “You guys know where I’m at. You know what I'm doing.”

After, Jim Citrin told Levinsohn he’d done well. Levinsohn was told that if the board decided to go in the “media” direction, the job was his.

Levinsohn left.

After enough time had passed to ensure that they wouldn’t spot each other, Mayer arrived by limo.

Anyone remotely familiar with her childhood, studies, and career could have predicted what happened next.

Mayer walked into that room at Gibson Dunn and blew them away.

She described her long familiarity with Yahoo and its products. She described how Yahoo products would evolve over time under her watch. Her presentation included an extraordinary amount of detail on Yahoo’s search business, audience analytics, and data. She talked about fixing Yahoo’s culture with more transparency, perks, and accountability. She named her perceived weaknesses, and explained how she planned to address them — including by hiring people who had the skills she didn’t have.

When Mayer was done, Jim Citrin told her he’d call her with the board’s decision by 8 p.m.

She left. The board still had a tough final decision to make.

A number of the Yahoo directors still opposed hiring Mayer. They argued that she didn’t have enough corporate experience. Some of the directors favored Levinsohn because they felt that the Third Point directors were just trying to install someone they could control. They had not overlooked that the “secret” location of the final interviews had been the offices of Third Point’s lawyers.

Brad Smith worried Mayer didn't have enough corporate experience.

The directors who opposed Mayer — most vocally Amoroso, but also Brad Smith and David Kenny — argued that Levinsohn, with his “media” strategy, had a better plan for Yahoo than Mayer and her “products” strategy.

They argued that Mayer may present a greater upside — she was more likely to come up with the next Facebook or Google Maps or Twitter — but that Levinsohn was the safer bet, a more guaranteed return.

Loeb, who had fought a bloody fight to get onto the board, and whose vote undoubtedly mattered the most, didn’t mind that Mayer was a high-risk, high-reward play. In his view, the sale of Yahoo’s Asian assets and the returning of those proceeds through share buybacks or dividends would provide enough of a “floor” in Yahoo’s value that it was worth betting on the greater upside Mayer brought to the table.

The 8 p.m. deadline came and went. Mayer, at a dinner party on the other side of town, tried to stop checking her phone.

At 9:45 p.m., the board still hadn’t called her. She signaled to her husband, Zachary Bogue, that she wanted to leave the party.

Wolf lobbied his fellow directors in favor of Mayer to the point of annoyance.

Finally, the pro-Mayer directors proposed a solution. What if they made Mayer the CEO and offered Levinsohn a huge amount of money to stay on as her chief operating officer? That way she’d be able to pursue her “products” strategy, and he could keep running the sales force and making deals with major media companies.

An informal vote was cast. The pro-Mayer directors were in the majority, with Amoroso and others voting against.

It was over. A formal vote was cast.

This time the board unanimously voted to name Marissa Mayer the new CEO of Yahoo.

Meanwhile, Mayer and Bogue had decided to stay at their dinner party, but it was finally time to go. As they began to say their goodbyes, Mayer’s phone finally rang. It was Jim Citrin. She let it go to voicemail.



The night after she interviewed, Jim Citrin left a message on Mayer's phone: “Marissa … you should be smiling. We’re smiling. Call me ASAP.”
Spencer Stuart

Jim Citrin called Marissa Mayer to offer her the job.

Citrin told her: “Marissa … you should be smiling. We’re smiling. Call me ASAP.”

When the board reached Mayer to offer her the job, she did not accept it right away. First she had some news to share.

She was five months pregnant. That’s why she hadn’t touched her wine at Michael Wolf’s apartment the month before.

The offer stood. After three days of negotiation with Wolf, she accepted.

The morning after Mayer got the voicemail from Citrin, Levinsohn was unaware that his fate had already been sealed. Once again he presented his plan for Yahoo to the board — this time with his executive team there to fill in the details.

He’d woken up that morning still feeling confident that he was going to get the job. But this was the meeting where, midway through, Loeb left to go to the bathroom and Wolf stood with Wilson to loudly question the deals Heckman had been negotiating with Google, Microsoft, and others.

Levinsohn went into the weekend at Allen & Co.’s mogul conference at Sun Valley sure he’d lost the job, but unsure to whom. By Sunday, Ross Levinsohn had found out that the board had also interviewed Marissa Mayer. When he heard her name, he knew it was over.

On Monday, Levinsohn went to work. Yahoo had to report its second quarter earnings that week, and he worked with CFO Tim Morse’s team to prepare some remarks for the company’s conference call with analysts. Levinsohn kept telling the team, “don’t write this for me, write it for a CEO. It should be generic.”

When that was done, Levinsohn went back to his office to wait for the news. He’d wanted this job. He’d fought for it. He’d done well.

Fred Amoroso broke the bad news to Levinsohn.

Finally, Fred Amoroso walked into Levinsohn's office and delivered the blow.

Back in New York and barely off a British Airways plane now heading for London, Michael Barrett joined a conference call with other top Yahoo executives.

Amoroso explained the news.

He said, “We love Ross. We thank Ross. We want him to stay. We weren’t looking for someone like Marissa, but when she showed up, boy were we impressed.”

“Although it was a hard decision, and we think Ross is doing a great job, she brings a different level of perspective and talent to the organization we couldn’t pass up.”

On Tuesday, July 17, 2012, David Filo stood waiting at the entrance of Yahoo’s headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif. He was very excited.

Filo is a quiet, unassuming engineer for Yahoo. He works in a cubicle. He also happens to be a co-founder of the company.

Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and co-founder David Filo.



In 2012, Filo still owned 6 percent of Yahoo. He was its largest individual shareholder. According to Forbes, there were only 959 people on the planet with more money than him.

And yet, the reason Filo was waiting near the entrance of Yahoo was so that when Marissa Mayer arrived, he would be able to unfurl a long purple carpet before her feet.

Yahoo’s hero was coming. But huge challenges faced her.

Yahoo’s websites were getting fewer and fewer visitors every year. Meanwhile, Yahoo’s mobile apps were being largely ignored.

For years, Yahoo’s most talented executives and engineers had been quitting the company to join faster-moving rivals like Facebook and Google. Those who stayed at Yahoo tended to show up late and leave early, or log in from home. Mayer had to fix Yahoo’s culture.

Mayer also walked into the office that day seven months pregnant. Her new colleagues looked to see if she was showing. They wondered how in the world she would manage a baby and the huge job ahead of her.

Marissa Mayer HOPE posterThe excitement was everywhere in the building. One enthusiastic Yahoo employee had made a poster with Mayer’s face on it in the style of Shepard Fairey’s 2008 campaign poster for Barack Obama. Across the lower third, the poster has one word in all-caps: “HOPE.”

When she finally arrived, Mayer’s first job was to meet the one group of Yahoo employees who were not as excited by her arrival — Yahoo’s senior executives, several of whom had risen to their jobs thanks to Ross Levinsohn.

Levinsohn, despite personal pleas from Amoroso and whispers of a generous compensation package, was not staying as Mayer’s chief operating officer. Since he took the interim job in May, he’d warned the board that if he didn’t get the permanent gig, he was going to try to become a CEO somewhere else.

If Levinsohn ever had any notion of reconsidering, that was squashed by his first scheduled meeting with Mayer.

After he’d learned that she was getting the job, he’d flown back home to Los Angeles. When Mayer said she wanted to meet, he agreed to fly back up to Sunnyvale. But when he showed up at their appointed time, Mayer’s assistant told Levinsohn she was running late.

Levinsohn said to the assistant, “My office is three doors down. I'll be in there.”

Suddenly anxious, the assistant said: “You have to wait here.”

She wanted him to wait so that when Mayer was done with whatever she was doing, he would be immediately available.

Levinsohn said, “Not so much.” He walked away.

Soon he walked out of the building for good.

Levinsohn decided that no good would come of him staying. He could see what would happen: Yahoo would devolve into a place where there were his people and there were Mayer’s people. The whole “media” versus “products” battle would rage on, and it would be an ugly fight.

And so, feeling that the rug had just been ripped out from underneath them, Yahoo’s senior executives walked into Mayer’s new office at Yahoo — the one Fred Amoroso had been using days before.

Many of these people were meeting Mayer for the first time, and they expected to sit across from the woman they’d read about in so many fluffy profiles and had seen on TV or onstage at conferences — someone who was charismatic and warm; personal.

That was not what they got.




Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer takes notes
TechCrunch

One by one, they walked in and sat down at a table across from Mayer. Then, she launched into questions. She asked: “Where did you get your education?” “Where are you from?” “What do you do here?” And so on.

As Yahoo executives answered, Mayer took notes on their answers with pen on paper, hardly looking up.

“It kind of felt like you were summoned to the principal’s office,” says one executive who went through one of these introductory meetings with Mayer.

“You would have thought a fair portion of [that meeting] would have been about ‘so what are you going through? How are you feeling? Sorry about Ross. We love him. We’d like to keep him. Realistically, he won’t stay but that doesn’t have any impact on you.’

“There wasn’t any kind of commiseration or any kind of bear hug. There wasn’t even a question of ‘Are you in or are you out?’ It was: ‘I assume you’re in. Let me know otherwise.’

“There was no time for short conversation or human emotions. It was very boom, boom, boom.

“Most people walked away from that meeting saying, ‘Holy shit.’”

One Yahoo executive attended such an introductory meeting between his boss and Mayer. His boss asked Mayer “Would you like to meet the people I brought?”

Mayer looked at them.

“No.”

The truth is, the person Yahoo’s top executives sat across from in those first meetings was not the Marissa Mayer they thought they knew from the media coverage of her. It was the Marissa Mayer her Stanford classmate Josh Elman remembers from late night study sessions.

Just as during those all-nighters almost 20 years before, Mayer wasn’t at Yahoo to socialize. In one early meeting Mayer said that Yahoo was going to fail — shut down — in the next few years if it did not get things going soon. She told a top product executive that Yahoo lagged in innovation and talent, and that its culture was broken.

She was there to save the company, and that was going to take a lot of work. It was past time to get started.

Some of the executives Mayer met with had a hard time connecting with her. Just as some of her Stanford study mates mistook her shyness for being “stuck up,” some of her new Yahoo colleagues took her all-business attitude as being “demeaning.”

For the people who were making Yahoo’s products at the time, the meetings were even more intense.

A designer or a top product manager would sit down and Mayer would assault them with a series of questions.

“How was that researched?”

“What was the research methodology?”

“How did you back that up?”

One person who went through a Mayer grilling says, “It was scary for a lot of people because of its intensity.”



Jim Heckman
jdlasica

Jim Heckman's and Marissa Mayer's personalities clashed.

The most pivotal meeting Mayer had in her first few days at Yahoo was with Levinsohn’s dealmaker, Jim Heckman.

She had to learn exactly what Heckman had been negotiating with Yahoo’s competitors. She had to decide whether or not to finalize these deals or to unwind them altogether. More broadly, Mayer had to understand the direction Heckman and Levinsohn had been taking Yahoo, and decide whether to keep it going that way or to slam on the brakes.

It is possible that, in the history of business, there has never been a meeting between two people whose personalities, styles, and priorities clash more than Mayer’s and Heckman’s.

Mayer is passionate about the pixels in the picture. She’s shy. She’s careful. She’s bold, but not reckless. She’s idealistic about people. She'll pay $60,000 to meet a designer, but wear his dress modestly.

Jim Heckman breaks glass. He’s squinty-eyed and caffeinated. He makes deals. He uses your first name. He quotes the comedian Daniel Tosh of Tosh.0. He doesn’t care about the headcount; he cares about the bottom line. Once, at a Yahoo party held on a yacht during the Cannes Lions Festival in France, Heckman brought a date who decided to go topless. There was a lot of shouting on the yacht.

Heckman met with Mayer during her first few days at Yahoo. Heckman laid out the plan he and Levinsohn had been working on for the past year. If implemented it would have completely changed the way Yahoo did business.

Yahoo makes its money by selling advertising. Heckman and Levinsohn believed that Yahoo had spent too much money and too much time trying to invent advertising technology that would allow Yahoo to charge higher ad rates. He believed that companies like Google, Microsoft, and AppNexus were far ahead of Yahoo in the world of ad tech, and that Yahoo was better off partnering with one of those companies and getting rid of the people it employed to work on ad tech.

Heckman told Mayer he believed partner ad technology would immediately raise Yahoo’s ad rates.

Moreover, with the money Yahoo would save by getting rid of the people it had working on ad tech, it could go out and buy high quality video content from Hollywood studios. He argued that advertisers would be willing to pay much higher ad rates if Yahoo’s content quality were higher. He said rates could go from under $2 per 1,000 impressions to $20.

In Heckman’s vision, Yahoo.com was more like a cable TV provider with a large, installed audience, than it was a maker of technology products.



Steve Ballmer Microsoft
Microsoft

Steve Ballmer was ready to give MSN.com to Yahoo.

Heckman said he already had a deal negotiated with Google executive Henrique De Castro to begin using Google’s advertising technology instead of Yahoo’s.

Heckman said the same theory could be applied to other second-, third-, or fourth-place Yahoo businesses. He talked about how Boeing lets General Electric, Rolls-Royce, and Pratt-Whitney make the actual engines for its airplanes.

He told Mayer that he’d negotiated a deal with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, wherein Yahoo would turn over its entire search business — patents and all — in exchange for Microsoft’s large online media property, MSN.com, and long-term, guaranteed cash payments.

Heckman said his plan would allow Yahoo to run with just 4,000 full-time employees, far fewer than the 15,000 full-timers and thousands more contractors Yahoo employed then. He said Yahoo EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) would increase by 50 percent if Mayer closed his deals.

Mayer heard him out, taking notes the whole time.

Within 24 hours, Mayer let Heckman know that she’d canceled all his deals and that his services were no longer needed by Yahoo.

Heckman flew to Ibiza, Spain for a 30-day vacation.

Mayer began to hire her own people.

Ironically, one of her biggest hires in her first few months at Yahoo was the Google executive Jim Heckman had been negotiating with, Henrique De Castro.

Mayer made De Castro Yahoo’s COO, and agreed to pay him as much as $62 million over four years, not counting annual stock grants.

This hire came as a surprise to Michael Barrett, the Google executive Ross Levinsohn had hired to run Yahoo ad sales. Though Barrett had been hired by Levinsohn, he was trying to make a go of things at Mayer’s Yahoo.

Barrett had heard rumors that Mayer was going to hire someone to replace him, but when he confronted her about them she said she wasn’t going to hire anyone above him, and certainly not Henrique De Castro. She even hinted that Barrett could be Yahoo’s chief operating officer.

But then Barrett read a story on AllThingsD.com saying that De Castro had been hired.

Hurt, but politic, he called Mayer’s office intending to congratulate her on the big hire. He wanted to begin discussing his own exit, as well.

Barrett got Mayer’s assistant.

She said, “Marissa is unavailable. I’m sure she’d love to hear from you. Could I have her call you back?”

Barrett said fine.

Mayer called him back while he was out to dinner in San Francisco.

As he picked up the phone, he expected her to begin the conversation with an apology for blindsiding him.

But all Mayer said was, “You called?”

Stunned that Mayer would either pretend to not know why he called or actually didn’t know why, Barrett said, “Yeah, I just wanted to say congrats on Henrique. He sounds like a really great hire.”

Mayer said, “I wasn’t able to tell anyone I was hiring him. I don’t think you should feel bad.”

“I don’t really feel bad at all,” he said.

The two never talked again, and Barrett left Yahoo with a severance package worth many millions of dollars.




Henrique De Castro, Google
All Things D

Henrique De Castro's nickname is “the most interesting man in the world,” after the Dos Equis spokesman.

De Castro has a distinct reputation among his former colleagues on the advertising side of Google’s business. All consider him sharp and effective. But he speaks with a heavy accent, is considered deeply pompous, and likes to speak in aphorisms. His nickname is “the most interesting man in the world,” after the Dos Equis spokesman.

Mayer’s next most important and controversial hire was a longtime private equity investor named Jacqueline Reses.

Though Reses had no experience in human resources, Mayer put her in charge of it at Yahoo. Mayer hired Reses because Mayer’s plan to improve the talent level at Yahoo was to buy lots of failed startups for small amounts of money.

Mayer believed that Reses would be expert at nailing down those kinds of transactions. She has been. In Mayer’s first year, Yahoo bought more than 20 startups.

Jackie Reses is Mayer's executive bagman.

Reses, a “gruff” and “matter-of-fact,” executive also served another purpose for Mayer: executioner. In December 2012, she called up Michael Katz, a Yahoo executive based in New York, and asked him out for a drink at a Mexican restaurant called Dos Caminos. It was a Sunday and Katz was celebrating the second night of Hanukkah, but he figured Reses would only ask him out at such an inconvenient time for something important. One drink in, she fired him — just weeks before a multimillion-dollar bonus was due. (He sued.)

Mayer replaced Levinsohn’s chief marketing officer, Mollie Spillman, in August — while Spillman was on vacation. The new CMO was Kathy Savitt, a “bubbly” and “charismatic” executive who’d founded a startup in 2009 after running marketing for teen retail giant American Eagle Outfitters.

After completing the sale of some Alibaba stock back to Alibaba and netting Yahoo almost $8 billion in cash, CFO Tim Morse left the company at the end of September 2012. Mayer hired the plain-spoken Ken Goldman to replace him.

Mayer kept some of Levinsohn’s people in place during her first year. Media boss Mickie Rosen would last until July 2013.

In the middle of all this, a baby

Marissa Mayer and her babyOn Sept. 30, 2012 Mayer gave birth to a baby boy. For weeks, Mayer and Bogue called their child only “BBBB” for “Big Baby Boy Bogue.” They would eventually name him Macallister.

Mayer’s pregnancy had been a fascination of the media, women around the world, and plenty of her Yahoo coworkers. Everyone wondered how she would handle having a newborn while trying to turn around a multibillion-dollar public company.

Mayer made the baby-raising part look easy.

She took just a two-week maternity leave. Then, two months after giving birth, Mayer told the audience at a conference on women in business: “The baby’s been way easier than everyone made it out to be.”

What Mayer didn’t say was that, thanks to her incredible wealth and power at Yahoo, she had a lot of help with Macallister. At home, she had a full-time staff. At Yahoo, she knocked down a wall in her office and set up a nursery so that Macallister — and his nanny — could come to the office with her every day.

The comments upset a lot of women. Lisa Belkin of The Huffington Post wrote an open letter to Mayer, in which she said, “Dear Marissa Mayer … Putting ‘baby’ and ‘easy’ in the same sentence turns you into one of those mothers we don’t like very much.”

Many of the same women would also take issue with Mayer in the spring of 2013, when she banned employees from working from home. Working from home was a convenient way for many of them to continue their careers after giving birth. Why was Mayer taking such a stance against it?

Mayer hadn’t intended to make a statement. She’d only wanted more people in the office at Yahoo. As for fighting for the working conditions of women, Mayer says that she is not a “feminist.” She says she is “blind to gender.”

Mayer goes missing

By the middle of the fall of 2012, a camaraderie developed between all of Mayer’s direct reports, and enthusiasm in the Yahoo workforce was swelling.

This was in part due to a series of cultural reforms Mayer brought to Yahoo almost immediately upon her arrival.

She wanted to recreate the high-energy, high-productivity culture of Google’s early days, when she had been happy working 100-hour weeks as a programmer.

She made the food free and started taking her own lunches in the employee cafeteria. She took down cubicle walls. She joined in on email chains with lower-level employees. She banned BlackBerrys and gave top-of-the-line company smartphones to every employee. She created a forum where employees could complain about issues and suggest solutions. Parking lots that had been empty until 10 a.m. and again after 4 p.m. were suddenly full from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.

On Fridays, Mayer would host a weekly meeting she called “FYI.” All Yahoo employees were invited. She’d go over her plans for the company, that week’s “wins” for Yahoo, and answer questions from the crowd.

Mayer dazzled. She was in her element. It was like she was back at Stanford, teaching fellow undergraduates the material she’d just learned the year before.

“If you go to the Friday meetings, it’s like a Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting,” says one executive who attended them.

“We would take the stage after she would open, so we were standing off the stage, watching the audience. You should have sees the rapture in their eyes. They were like smitten teenagers. It is unbelievable.

“She is deified. The first 50 rows are packed with the engineering team and they’re cheering her on. There is no question that there’s a palpable level of energy and renewed enthusiasm and renewed pride.”

Just a few weeks in, Yahoo employee morale and productivity hit a high not seen in a decade.

There was only one serious complaint from Mayer’s top executives: She never seemed to be around when they needed her. What was she working on all the time?

Mayer demanded all of her staff across the world join the call, so executives from New York, where it was 6 p.m., and Europe, where it was as late as midnight would dial-in too.

Inevitably, Mayer herself would show up at least 45 minutes late. Some calls started so late that Yahoo’s executives in Europe didn’t hang up till 3 a.m. their time.

One of Mayer’s former Google colleagues says the lateness habit is something Mayer picked up during her 13 years at Google.

Even executives hired by Mayer, like CMO Kathy Savitt, felt ignored by her early on.



“Eric, Larry, and Sergey were always late and causing everybody in the organization to be late. They would hold you over, and then you would be late. And then the next meeting would start late and then run late. And then all of the staff in that meeting would be late. It would just trickle down through the organization. Is Marissa Mayer always late? Well, yeah. But it was endemic to the organization.”

Mayer’s lateness was a pain, sure. But by the early fall of 2012, Mayer’s staff had grown used to it. In fact, they were actually glad when she’d show up late to a meeting, because that meant at least she hadn’t blown it off entirely.

Mayer had approximately 25 people reporting directly to her during her first year at Yahoo. In theory, she was keeping up with each of them in a regularly scheduled weekly meeting. In practice, she would go weeks without talking to people because she was so busy.

For a while, each of those 25 people thought that Mayer was just picking on them, individually. The people who had been at Yahoo before Mayer joined assumed that this meant she was going to fire them soon. The people Mayer had just hired into the company, including Reses and Savitt, were even more puzzled. Why had they been hired only to be ignored?

But then, during one of those long waiting periods after 3 p.m. on a Monday, a conversation unfurled that revealed all.

Making small talk, one executive said to another: “Did she cancel one of your one-on-ones again?”

A third jumped in: “Oh my god, she does that to you too?”

It turned out that everyone in the room and on the call had been canceled on by Mayer, frequently.

“Everyone assumed that they were the only one being canceled on. But then they realized that they weren’t,” says one person who was in those meetings.

The problem with Mayer canceling her scheduled meetings with everyone is that it was otherwise impossible to see her.

“That was your only point of contact with her. There wasn’t a lot of serendipity of bumping into her or having her pop her head into a meeting. Getting onto her calendar was nothing short of impossible.”

One person who kept getting blown off by Mayer remembers thinking: “I may not be you, but I'm running a huge part of your business. I've got thousands of people reporting to me. The chance that I would miss a meeting with my directs without an explanation is none.

“First of all, I don’t miss those meetings. Maybe it happens once in a year because of something. But then I'm going to pick up the phone and I'm going to call them and I'm going to apologize and I'm going to say I'm sorry, I'll make it up to you, let’s schedule some other time. I'm not going to make them wait for more than five minutes because I know they have incredibly important things to do. And they are human beings.”

During those staff meetings, Mayer made little time for certain topics early on — especially those having to do with revenue, advertising technology, or distribution.

Mayer would only entertain three deals per week, and it was quickly obvious the ones she would always prefer to talk about: anything to do with product. If Reses wanted to talk about an aqui-hire that would bring a talented product manager into Yahoo, Mayer would prioritize the conversation. If there was talk of a partnership with Apple on a new Weather app, that would definitely be discussed.

There was a reason for Mayer’s lateness, for the skipped meetings, and for the priority of product discussions during those meetings, though.

Prior to joining Yahoo, Mayer had decided the company’s many problems boiled down to one: everything going out the front door from PR to marketing to products was flawed. In her first months at the company, Mayer’s plan was to immediately stop that from happening ever again.

It would take an incredible amount of time and effort. Picture a dam sprouting leaks, and Mayer trying to plug them with all her fingers and toes.

“Who is this woman and what is she actually saying?”

A week after Mayer joined Yahoo, a Yahoo employee took a photo of one of the purple-on-purple Marissa Mayer HOPE posters taped to the walls of Yahoo and sent it to a Google employee named Hunter Walk.

Walk tweeted it, and soon the poster was a news story.

One of Mayer’s former subordinates from Google, Katie Jacobs Stanton, by then a vice president at Twitter, saw the tweet, and replied to Walk in her own public tweet. She wrote: “I hope that went through UI review :)”

The joke is a reference to the user-interface reviews that Mayer famously insisted on conducting for every consumer-facing Web product Google launched from 2005 to 2010 before she was removed from the top of the search products organization.

Stanton was suggesting that the Mayer she knew, the one she once reported to, would soon have strict control over all of Yahoo, and especially anything Yahoo made for the public’s consumption.

Stanton was spot on.

Upon taking control of Yahoo, Mayer’s first instinct was to survey and quantify everything that Yahoo was doing that the public could see, and then start controlling it.

This applied to all areas of Yahoo, including public relations. Throughout the fall, every week, all the Yahoo PR people had to complete a big spreadsheet with the names of every reporter they wanted to talk to and what the business objective was. This spreadsheet was then submitted to the head of Yahoo PR, Anne Espiritu. Espiritu would then submit the form to Mayer. Mayer, in turn, would approve or reject every call or email and then pass the form back down the line.

If Yahoo’s public relations staff had any complaints about these tactics, they could bring them to Espiritu during her weekly office hours.

No group had a shorter leash than Yahoo’s largest, most important team: the hundreds of people in charge of creating, developing, designing, and updating Yahoo products.

On Tuesday, Dec. 11, 2012, Marissa Mayer wrote a blog post announcing a new version of Yahoo Mail for the Web, Windows 8, the iPhone, and Android.

It was a huge moment for the new Yahoo. No Yahoo product, perhaps other than the Yahoo home page, is as important to Yahoo as Yahoo Mail. It’s the biggest reason any of Yahoo’s 700 million users ever bother to go to Yahoo.com in the first place. And over the previous few years, it had slowly been losing users.

“Email is the ultimate daily habit,” Mayer says in the post. “It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed.”

Three months before those words hit the Web, Mayer and 30 designers, product managers, and engineers sat around a huge table in one of Yahoo’s large, traditional conference rooms.

Mayer was talking. Fast. As she spoke, two of the people seated near her typed away like crazy, trying to take verbatim notes in Google Docs. They were struggling to keep up.

This group of people had been meeting three times a week for a month, and they’d turned the conference room into a space that now looked more like a design studio. Windows ran down one side of the room. On the other side, projectors hung from the ceiling, rendering screens on the wall. Between the projections stood 20 or 30 huge pieces of foam core pinned up with a collection of ideas about what a new Yahoo home page and a new Yahoo email could look like.

For the 30 people sitting around the table, their first meetings with Mayer over the past month had been terrifying.

For years, Yahoo had been a place where the CEO was a distant figure who would meet with various members of his or her executive leadership team to lay out broad strategies for each function: design, technology, product, etc.

Mayer skipped all that.

“She was like ‘yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll get to that. Let’s first get some stuff out the door that actually works,’” says a witness to those early days.

It was a level of energized scrutiny none of them were used to.

Mayer came at them with “a voracious flood of possibilities” about what the new products could look like. Her ideas were both big and small — minute even. Mayer displayed such a “profound capacity for detail,” that the leadership in the room finally set up the two transcribers so that later they could “share and dissect” all of Mayer’s ideas and decisions.

One of them remembers thinking: “Who is this woman and what is she actually saying?”

But soon, as the weeks wore on, the 30 people in that room began to learn how to respond to what Mayer was saying.

Some of the people in the room were growing frustrated with the pace, but others began contributing. Among those who contributed, Mayer learned who to trust. Those trusted people began to grow in confidence and they started to contribute even more.

Soon, these once-terrifying meetings became friendly, fun. Jokes started to fly around.

“It warmed up,” says someone who was in those meetings. “Once we learned how to operate on that level of intensity with her, she softened and it became more of an interaction.”

“You’d look at her and she’s smiling!”

This was Mayer in her ultimate element.

She was pushing the pace as she had those late nights working on problems for Philosophy 160A. She was teaching, as she had 3,000 Stanford undergraduates. She was creating, as she had those pompom routines 25 years before. She was using data to empathize with hundreds of millions of people all at once, as she had learned to do at Google.

“I've never seen anybody like [her],” says someone from those meetings. Mayer, he says, was “somebody who could see a whole collection of possibilities and could just talk about her experiences and principles.”

“In that way she would start to not only share how she was thinking, but also help us learn a lens to look through to be able to connect where she was coming from and what we were about.”

Yahoo MailMayer’s intensity was contagious. By November, the Yahoo Mail team was working nights and weekends, racing to finish by an insane early December deadline. This was a credit to Mayer and the leader of the Mail team, Shashi Seth, a product leader Mayer inherited.

Finally, the Mail team finished their work at the end of November. They were proud of their work, and they deserved to be. Never had Yahoo built and launched a version of Mail so quickly. The last time Yahoo had done it, it took 18 months to build the product and another six months to roll it out.

But then Yahoo learned another lesson about what making products would be like with Marissa Mayer as CEO.

One day before the new Yahoo Mail was set to launch, Mayer called a meeting with CMO Kathy Savitt, Shashi Seth, and the entire product and engineering leadership team — about 10 people in total. They met in Phish Food, the conference room where months before, Ross Levinsohn had pitched an alternate reality for Yahoo to a board that wasn’t really listening.

Everyone settled in; Mayer dropped a bombshell. For months, it had been decided that the new Yahoo Mail’s colors would be blue and gray. The thought was that users were going to be looking at Yahoo Mail on their phones all day long, and so it was best to choose the most subtly contrasting colors possible.

Mayer wanted to change the colors entirely — from blue and gray to purple and yellow.

Seth’s body language shifted immediately. He looked deflated. He was going to have to tell his people the news.

Changing the color of a product like Yahoo Mail sounds easy, but it’s not. Mayer’s decision meant that some unlucky group of people were going to have to manually go and change the color in literally thousands of places — all while working under a deadline.

Seth’s team got the changes done, but there was fallout from Mayer’s decision. The lead Yahoo Mail designer quit and went to Google. The Yahoo Mail product manager went to Disney. The lead engineer left and founded a startup. Seth himself left Yahoo in January 2013, a month after Mail launched.

One person, frustrated by the incident, says he’d hoped the Yahoo Mail launch would make people “incredibly proud of what they've accomplished” and that they would be inspired to “stick around for years to come.”

“It was the exact opposite,” he says.

But others have a different perspective.

Their view is that Mayer refused to launch a product that she didn’t think was finished. A product’s color may seem superficial, but Mayer is obsessed with data that shows it is not. At Yahoo’s scale, if you can change a color a little bit and affect the performance by some factor of 0.01 percent, that translates into millions of dollars.

In this view, when Mayer forced already burnt-out people to work even harder at the very last minute to make sure a product went out as good as it could be, she set a marker for the new era of Yahoo.

“The precedent made the next project easier to deal with,” says one person who helped launch Yahoo Mail. “We’d gotten comfortable with what Yahoo-ness was about.”




Adam Cahan
Mayer put Adam Cahan in charge of a new group called “Mobile and Emerging Products.”

Yahoo's mobile problem
When Mayer came to Yahoo in 2012, Yahoo’s mobile traffic was still tiny compared to other big tech companies like Google and Facebook. Yahoo’s mobile apps weren’t very popular either.

So when Mayer joined Yahoo, she knew that a top priority had to be developing mobile apps that consumers would make a part of their daily lives.

To try to figure out what those apps should be, Mayer conducted a survey.

The results made her laugh.

She learned that after activities like calling people, texting, and maps, the main things people do on their phones everyday are: check email, check weather, get news, get stock quotes, check sports scores, get entertainment news, share photos, communicate with groups, and ask questions.

What made Mayer laugh was that those are all things people go to Yahoo for on the Web. Yahoo’s biggest products are Yahoo Mail, Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports, and so on.

At a speech in New York in May 2013, Mayer said: “Yahoo has had the functionality and content people want on their phones. Now we need to get it into apps and the mobile web in a way people can really consume it on their phones.”

In her first year at Yahoo, Mayer made two big moves to expand mobile reach and usage.

The first move was to put a Yahoo executive named Adam Cahan in charge of a new group called “Mobile and Emerging Products.” Cahan came to Yahoo when it acquired his mobile startup, IntoNow, for $20 million in 2011.

Yahoo lacked the mobile talent to staff such a group, so Mayer spent $200 million at the end of 2012 and through August 2013 acquiring more than 20 mobile startups. In almost every case, Yahoo would shut down the startup’s product, sign its engineering and product development people to two- and four-year contracts, and integrate them into Cahan’s team.

Mayer’s second big move to improve Yahoo’s standing in mobile would turn out to be the biggest transaction of her entire career. It would cost Yahoo $1.1 billion.

Could Mayer close the deal?

On the evening of Thursday, May 16, 2013, 26-year-old David Karp looked at his iPhone and saw he had a voice mail from the chief operating officer of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg.

David Karp, founder and CEO of Tumblr.



He listened to her message. All Sandberg said was that she’d like Karp to call her back.

But she had said enough.

Karp, the founder of a blog network called Tumblr, told his investment banker Jonathan Turner at Qatalyst Partners about the voice mail.

They decided they had to call Yahoo and let them know Sandberg had called.

That day, All Things D reporter Kara Swisher and her colleague Peter Kafka had reported that Yahoo was in serious talks to buy Tumblr.

Karp, his board, and his bankers believed Sandberg was calling to see if the report was true, and if Facebook could possibly join the bidding for Tumblr.

On the one hand, a bidding war between Facebook and Yahoo would be great news for Tumblr, its bankers, and its investors.

On the other, Turner was terrified that the leak would spoil their deal. Mayer was from Google, and Google was infamous for pulling the plug on deals if it felt like the other side was trying to gin up interest in the press. Throughout every stage of the slow courtship between the companies, Turner had been paranoid about the press.

When Sheryl Sandberg left a voicemail on David Karp's phone, it threatened to blow up the deal.

After originally offering only $800 million to buy Tumblr, Yahoo had finally upped its bid to $1.1 billion and was going through the final stages of due diligence. The deal was basically done, and the Tumblr board didn’t think it was time to get greedy.

Still, Yahoo had to be told about the voice mail. The companies had signed an “exclusivity” agreement, which meant that Tumblr had to notify Yahoo of any other approaches.

Turner had nothing to worry about.

When Mayer found out about Sandberg’s voice mail, she only became more eager to get the deal done.

She went to her M&A team, led by “gruff” New Yorker Jackie Reses, and told them to hurry up and wrap things up; she didn’t want to lose out on Tumblr — not after all those months of work and so many meetings with Karp.

Talks between the two companies had begun in November 2012, when Karp went to Sunnyvale and met with Mayer.

By then, Tumblr, founded in 2007, had grown to an astounding 200 million worldwide users a month, but Karp still hadn’t figured out how the blog network could make a lot of money off all those users.

He was taking meetings on the West Coast to see if Google, Facebook, Microsoft, or Yahoo wanted to make a strategic investment. He thought one of those companies might want to sell ads on Tumblr.com and split the revenues.

That first meeting between Karp and Mayer left both parties cold. Mayer mostly talked about what she was trying to do at Yahoo, and a potential deal between the two companies didn’t really come up.

After the meeting, Karp told his board and his bankers that the new CEO of Yahoo was very nice, but that he didn’t see a deal happening.

At investment bank Qatalyst, Turner passed the news onto his boss, legendary tech banker Frank Quattrone.

Quattrone had gotten rich and powerful during the dot-com bubble. He also got in some hot water with the law, though he eventually extricated himself. He’s brash. He’s got a mustache. He looks like the cartoon version of a deal-making, back-slapping, investment banker. And yet, he’s probably the best deal-maker in the business.

Quattrone thought he would be able to get Mayer more interested in Tumblr. So, in early 2013, he met with her, and pointed out that one of Tumblr’s great strengths was how popular it was on mobile devices. He accurately noted the incredible amount of time young people were spending on Tumblr.

Quattrone had said the magic word: “mobile.”

Mayer said she’d take a second look.

When Marissa Mayer studies a topic, she doesn’t do it superficially. After her meeting with Quattrone, she spent an entire weekend using Tumblr, poking around the site, and studying metrics.

Mayer decided to get back in touch with Karp. Only, she didn’t want to do an advertising deal or make a strategic investment. She wanted to buy his company.

If that was going to happen, it was going to take some doing. Karp didn’t want to sell his company. Facebook and Google had started trying to talk him into it, but he refused, even though a sale would net him more than $100 million after taxes. He wanted to keep control over his company.

“She really took ownership of this, really persuaded David that she would let Tumblr stay independent.”



Mayer realized she needed to put on a full-court press.

Mayer flew to New York in February and had dinner with Karp and Jackie Reses on a Saturday night. Mayer was able to win Karp over that night. She said that Tumblr was an excellent product — an amazing tool for self-expression. She noted that it was beating Facebook with younger consumers.

That Saturday night, Mayer told Karp that she had a board meeting coming up soon, and that she’d like to bring up the possibility of buying Tumblr.

Would he be able to meet again that Sunday?

Karp agreed to meet again. That Sunday night over dinner, Mayer talked about how the new paradigm for tech acquisitions was for the acquiring company to allow the acquired company to continue operating independently, as a subsidiary with its own brand. She said that’s what Google had done with YouTube, what Facebook had done with Instagram, and it’s what Yahoo would do with Tumblr.

They stayed out till 2 a.m. Karp told Mayer to bring up the idea at her board meeting.

During her first-quarter board meeting, Mayer said she’d like to buy Tumblr. She said Tumblr would, in a snap, improve Yahoo’s position in mobile and make its overall audience much younger. The board gave her full support to pursue the deal.

Everything went fine from there. The All Things D report and Sandberg’s voice mail only hurried the process along.

Finally, over the next weekend, Karp and his board accepted Yahoo’s offer.

It was a triumph for Mayer and Yahoo.

For years, Yahoo had tried to acquire hot startups that would help it become more popular with users, and eventually begin growing its revenues again. But time and again, the entrepreneurial ambitious types running hot startups would refuse to sell to Yahoo, preferring to sell to Google or Facebook.

For Mayer, the deal showed how far she’d come as an executive. Her penchant for teacherly mentoring allowed her to cultivate a relationship with Karp and close a deal that had seemed impossible.

One source close to Tumblr’s now defunct board said he was blown away by how much effort Mayer put into the deal.

“Where I give her high marks is that you don’t typically get CEOs that engaged.”

“She really took ownership of this, really persuaded David that she would let Tumblr stay independent.

“She turned David around. He was very reluctant. He’s not motivated by money in the same way as the rest of us. He’s really passionate about the product. His concern about selling to Yahoo was that it would get subsumed.

“Marissa convinced David that this wasn’t the old Yahoo and that she’s going to run it differently.”




Epilogue_02

Now into her second year as Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer from Wausau, Wisc., says “I’m having the time of my life.”

A natural teacher, she has, in her 20s and 30s, turned that skill into the ability to inspire thousands of people to make technology products that millions of people use.

The challenge she’ll face in her 40s is: Can she become the rare, complete technology CEO who can create magical products and deliver financial results?

By one measure, Mayer did incredibly well during her first year. Since David Filo unrolled the purple carpet for Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s stock has gone from $15.74 per share to hovering around $28 in August 2013.

But, while investor confidence in Mayer’s vision and performance so far certainly plays some role in the stock’s magnificent surge, a much greater factor has been Alibaba, the Chinese Internet company in which Yahoo is a part-owner.

Yahoo has benefited from Alibaba in two ways.

In the months before Mayer joined Yahoo, CEO Scott Thompson and CFO Tim Morse hammered out a deal in which Alibaba bought back a small portion of Yahoo’s stake for $7.6 billion. When he was still CEO, Thompson signaled that he would use that money to buy back Yahoo shares, driving up their price. When she took over, Mayer went along with this plan.

Because of Alibaba, Yahoo has been able to spend billions of dollars buying its own stock. With the supply of shares shrinking, and a few billion dollars-worth of demand in the market, the shares have naturally risen.

The other way Alibaba has helped Yahoo shares grow in value is by growing in value itself.

Alibaba has yet to go public. Because Yahoo still owns a large stake in Alibaba, it is actually one of the few ways investors are able to place bets on it. Those bets even have a pay-off date. As a part of the deal Thompson and Morse negotiated, Yahoo will sell even more stock when Alibaba does finally IPO. Some analysts think Yahoo will get another $7 billion in cash out of that deal.

Another reason to be skeptical of Mayer’s performance is that the person more responsible than anyone else for her being the CEO of Yahoo, Third Point’s Dan Loeb, sold off most of his holdings in the company in July 2013. That month, he, Michael Wolf, and Harry Wilson resigned from Yahoo’s board, as their settlement with the board required them to do if Third Point’s stake in Yahoo ever fell below 2 percent.

Third Point remains a major Yahoo shareholder, but Loeb’s liquidation is still a strong signal that he thinks the upside from where Yahoo is now is more limited than it was in 2012.

All that said, there is no question that Mayer has drastically improved Yahoo in her short time there so far.

You can see it in the metrics. Yahoo claims that after Mayer’s redesigns, traffic to apps for Yahoo Mail is up 120 percent; Yahoo Weather, 150 percent; and Yahoo News, 55 percent. In her first year, Mayer was able to keep traffic to Yahoo Mail on the Web flat, and even slightly grow Yahoo.com. In an age where big websites usually shrink because people check their email and news on their phones, that’s remarkable. In the middle of August 2013, ComScore reported that Yahoo Web properties had passed Google properties as the most popular in the United States.

Beyond the metrics though, Mayer has revolutionized the culture at Yahoo.

One Yahoo executive told me that before Mayer arrived, “what was missing was leadership from the very top, which was able to cut to the chase and get some tough decisions made, get focused in the right places, get the sense of urgency, and also somebody who could really be the chief quality control leader of the company.”

And indeed, the quality of Yahoo products has gone up since Mayer arrived. The Yahoo Weather app that launched for iPhone in 2013 is stunning. Mayer’s redesign of Flickr is a delight.

Yes, some people don’t get along with her because of her direct, all-business style.

Sometimes her brusque manner comes off as rude, “demeaning,” or “stuck up.” It can insult people.

But even some of those people say Yahoo has become a far more vibrant place under her leadership.

One person Mayer frequently clashed with at Yahoo told me, “You have to give Marissa a lot of credit. Just because I don’t like what she’s done to me and I don’t like what she’s done to many other people, doesn’t mean I'm going to shy away from giving her credit. She brought life back to Yahoo. There’s no question about it.

“The Friday before she came on, the parking lots would be empty till 10 a.m. and would be empty again after 4 p.m. That happened day after day after day for seven months in a row. Marissa comes, the next week, the parking lots are full at 8 a.m. and people are still there at 6:30.

“The changes that she brought — making food free, focusing on quality, shutting some things down, being open and honest during the Friday FYI meetings — all brought belief back for a lot of people.”

“If she hadn’t come in, all the smart people would have left.

“And that would have been the end of Yahoo.”

A note on sources

═══

This story is based primarily on first-hand reporting consisting of dozens of interviews.

This story would not exist if not for the cooperation of many people who did speak with me, including those who grew up with Mayer, taught her, or worked with her at Google and Yahoo. Some of these people are or were employed at Yahoo and spoke to me at the risk of their careers. Many of these people spoke on a not-for-attribution basis. Some spoke on the record. I have not identified many on-the-record sources because I did not want to allow for the process of elimination to identify others.

This story, being told in a narrative fashion, does not identify the sources of information for particular facts, including thoughts. I would caution readers against assuming that because I have reported a person’s thoughts, that person is a direct source. A person will often share thoughts about pivotal moments in their lives with a large group of people.

As a part of the narrative, my story includes dialogue.

I am grateful to James B. Stewart’s “note on sources” at the end of his book, “DisneyWar.” That note helped me think about how to describe my own sourcing. In his note, Stewart describes how he sources dialogue. It’s a perfect explanation, and I’d like to quote it and use it as my own explanation.

“As part of the narrative, I have included passages of dialogue. Dialogue— what words were said— is a fact like any other. It is not necessarily a quotation from an interview with me and I would discourage readers from inferring that one or both of the speakers is a direct source. Especially in today’s world of instant communication, it is sometimes amazing how many people turn out to be privy to what others may assume is a private conversation. Many of the conversations reported in this book either took place before an audience or became known to a wide circle of people, often within minutes of their taking place. … In a few cases other people were listening in on speakerphones, extensions, or overheard conversations without one or both of the speakers’ knowledge. Readers should bear in mind that, given the vagaries of human memory, remembered dialogue is rarely the same as actual recordings and transcripts. At the same time, it is no more nor less accurate than many other recollections.”

 Awesome article Nick. My 2c on the demotion, not sure if it is accurate: When Bing launched it was a bit of a wake up call to Google since objectively it was better at search across a number of dimensions, specifically image search and vertical search in health and travel. At Google search had been stagnating at that time, and vertical search in particular was considered an unexciting area for investment. I've got to believe that these factors played a role in tarnishing her image at the company since it put the core into jeopardy.

 One of the better articles I have read about technology executives, and i have read thousands. Beautifully develops the foundational components of her personality, and then objectively assesses the arc of her career, with appropriate highlighting. My high school senior is devouring the article, and hopefully she draws inspiration from a talented and driven Marissa.

 Great writing Nicholas! This is BusinessInsider at its best. I read EVERY word, didn't skip ahead. That is great writing.
 Marissa is a special person. I am a huge fan. She always had time for me as a low level Googler, and even when I worked for Microsoft. I was surprised at the "robot" characterization by people who have worked with her, but perhaps that was a reaction to the way she juggles hundreds of balls at a time. That has not been my experience.

 Yahoo is lucky to have Marissa as CEO. She has done what none of the previous CEOs could do. She has inspired Yahoo employees, given them confidence, and convinced the stock market she has a winning plan. More than anything Yahoo had a crisis of confidence. Marissa has fixed that. No one else could.

 Henry, give Nicholas a raise, and give him the time to write more stories like this. This is quality journalism that will attract readers and advertisers.

 Thank you for a well-written, balanced article. There is so much lionizing and vilifying of this woman in the press that it's hard to separate fact from fiction. What I enjoyed, particularly, about this narrative is how it provides coherence and causality rather than the jigsawing together a bunch of provocative cliches and soundbites.

 I don't want to reduce this story to a gender thing - no one's life is just about their gender, of course. But, I know many women in the tech world like the Mayer described here, especially in her earlier days - focused, driven, very smart, uncompromising, with a greater cognitive capacity than most around her and a visionary who can see both the big picture and the little details. This isn't to say that some men are not all of these things as well. Nor does it mean that these women are perfect in every way. But, somehow, it seems that we are not evolved enough yet in the world of business / tech, to give these women the same amount of leeway that we give to similar men. For example, I wonder if Scott Thompson or Ross Levinsohn, who were likely not perfect when leading Yahoo, got as much press or critiquing about their leadership / management styles. I don't recall much at all.

Nearly half a century ago, when Elvis Presley was filming “Harum Scarum” and “Help!” was on the charts, a moody, father-haunted, yet uncannily charismatic Shore rat named Bruce Springsteen was building a small reputation around central Jersey as a guitar player in a band called the Castiles. The band was named for the lead singer’s favorite brand of soap. Its members were from Freehold, an industrial town half an hour inland from the boardwalk carnies and the sea. The Castiles performed at sweet sixteens and Elks-club dances, at drive-in movie theatres and ShopRite ribbon cuttings, at a mobile-home park in Farmingdale, at the Matawan-Keyport Rollerdrome. Once, they played for the patients at a psychiatric hospital, in Marlboro. A gentleman dressed in a suit came to the stage and, in an introductory speech that ran some twenty minutes, declared the Castiles “greater than the Beatles.” At which point a doctor intervened and escorted him back to his room.

One spring afternoon in 1966, the Castiles, with dreams of making it big and making it quick, drove to a studio at the Brick Mall Shopping Center and recorded two original songs, “Baby I” and “That’s What You Get.” Mainly, though, they played an array of covers, from Glenn Miller’s “In the Mood” to the G-Clefs’ “I Understand.” They did Sonny and Cher, Sam and Dave, Don & Juan, the Who, the Kinks, the Stones, the Animals.

Many musicians in their grizzled late maturity have an uncertain grasp on their earliest days on the bandstand. (Not a few have an uncertain grasp on last week.) But Springsteen, who is sixty-two and among the most durable musicians since B. B. King and Om Kalthoum, seems to remember every gaudy night, from the moment, in 1957, when he and his mother watched Elvis on “The Ed Sullivan Show”—“I looked at her and I said, ‘I wanna be just . . . like . . . that’ ”—to his most recent exploits as a multimillionaire populist rock star crowd-surfing the adoring masses. These days, he is the subject of historical exhibitions; at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum, in Cleveland, and at the National Constitution Center, in Philadelphia, his lyric sheets, old cars, and faded performing duds have been displayed like the snippets of the Shroud. But, unlike the Rolling Stones, say, who have not written a great song since the disco era and come together only to pad their fortunes as their own cover band, Springsteen refuses to be a mercenary curator of his past. He continues to evolve as an artist, filling one spiral notebook after another with ideas, quotations, questions, clippings, and, ultimately, new songs. His latest album, “Wrecking Ball,” is a melodic indictment of the recessionary moment, of income disparity, emasculated workers, and what he calls “the distance between the American reality and the American dream.” The work is remote from his early operettas of humid summer interludes and abandon out on the Turnpike. In his desire to extend a counter-tradition of political progressivism, Springsteen quotes from Irish rebel songs, Dust Bowl ballads, Civil War tunes, and chain-gang chants.

Early this year, Springsteen was leading rehearsals for a world tour at Fort Monmouth, an Army base that was shut down last year; it had been an outpost since the First World War of military communications and intelligence, and once employed Julius Rosenberg and thousands of militarized carrier pigeons. The twelve-hundred-acre property is now a ghost town inhabited only by steel dummies meant to scare off the ubiquitous Canada geese that squirt a carpet of green across middle Jersey. Driving to the far end of the base, I reached an unlovely theatre that Springsteen and Jon Landau, his longtime manager, had rented for the rehearsals. Springsteen had performed for officers’ children at the Fort Monmouth “teen club” (dancing, no liquor) with the Castiles, forty-seven years earlier.

The atmosphere inside was purposeful but easygoing. Musicians stood onstage noodling on their instruments with the languid air of outfielders warming up in the sun. Max Weinberg, the band’s volcanic drummer, wore the sort of generous jeans favored by dads at weekend barbecues. Steve Van Zandt, Springsteen’s childhood friend and guitarist-wingman, keeps up a brutal schedule as an actor and a d.j., and he seemed weary, his eyes drooping under a piratical purple head scarf. The bass player Garry Tallent, the organist Charlie Giordano, and the pianist Roy Bittan horsed around on a roller-rink tune while they waited. The guitarist Nils Lofgren was on the phone, trying to figure out flights to get back to his home, in Scottsdale, for the weekend.

Springsteen arrived and greeted everyone with a quick hello and his distinctive cackle. He is five-nine and walks with a rolling rodeo gait. When he takes in something new—a visitor, a thought, a passing car in the distance—his eyes narrow, as if in hard light, and his lower jaw protrudes a bit. His hairline is receding, and, if one had to guess, he has, over the years, in the face of high-def scrutiny and the fight against time, enjoined the expensive attentions of cosmetic and dental practitioners. He remains dispiritingly handsome, preposterously fit. (“He has practically the same waist size as when I met him, when we were fifteen,” says Steve Van Zandt, who does not.) Some of this has to do with his abstemious inclinations; Van Zandt says Springsteen is “the only guy I know—I think the only guy I know at all—who never did drugs.” He’s followed more or less the same exercise regimen for thirty years: he runs on a treadmill and, with a trainer, works out with weights. It has paid off. His muscle tone approximates a fresh tennis ball. And yet, with the tour a month away, he laughed at the idea that he was ready. “I’m not remotely close,” he said, slumping into a chair twenty rows back from the stage.

Preparing for a tour is a process far more involved than middle-aged workouts designed to stave off premature infarction. “Think of it this way: performing is like sprinting while screaming for three, four minutes,” Springsteen said. “And then you do it again. And then you do it again. And then you walk a little, shouting the whole time. And so on. Your adrenaline quickly overwhelms your conditioning.” His style in performance is joyously demonic, as close as a white man of Social Security age can get to James Brown circa 1962 without risking a herniated disk or a shattered pelvis. Concerts last in excess of three hours, without a break, and he is constantly dancing, screaming, imploring, mugging, kicking, windmilling, crowd-surfing, climbing a drum riser, jumping on an amp, leaping off Roy Bittan’s piano. The display of energy and its depletion is part of what is expected of him. In return, the crowd participates in a display of communal adoration. Like pilgrims at a gigantic outdoor Mass—think John Paul II at Gdansk—they know their role: when to raise their hands, when to sway, when to sing, when to scream his name, when to bear his body, hand over hand, from the rear of the orchestra to the stage. (Van Zandt: “Messianic? Is that the word you’re looking for?”)

Springsteen came to glory in the age of Letterman, but he is anti-ironical. Keith Richards works at seeming not to give a shit. He makes you wonder if it is harder to play the riffs for “Street Fighting Man” or to dangle a cigarette from his lips by a single thread of spit. Springsteen is the opposite. He is all about flagrant exertion. There always comes a moment in a Springsteen concert, as there always did with James Brown, when he plays out a dumb show of the conflict between exhaustion and the urge to go on. Brown enacted it by dropping to his knees, awash in sweat, unable to dance another step, yet shooing away his cape bearer, the aide who would enrobe him and hustle him offstage. Springsteen slumps against the mike stand, spent and still, then, regaining consciousness, shakes off the sweat—No! It can’t be!—and calls on the band for another verse, another song. He leaves the stage soaked, as if he had swum around the arena in his clothes while being chased by barracudas. “I want an extreme experience,” he says. He wants his audience to leave the arena, as he commands them, “with your hands hurting, your feet hurting, your back hurting, your voice sore, and your sexual organs stimulated!”

So the display of exuberance is critical. “For an adult, the world is constantly trying to clamp down on itself,” he says. “Routine, responsibility, decay of institutions, corruption: this is all the world closing in. Music, when it’s really great, pries that shit back open and lets people back in, it lets light in, and air in, and energy in, and sends people home with that and sends me back to the hotel with it. People carry that with them sometimes for a very long period of time.”

The band rehearses not so much to learn how to play particular songs as to see what songs work with other songs, to figure out a basic set list (with countless alternatives) that will fill all of Springsteen’s demands: to air the new work and his latest themes; to play the expected hits for the casual fans; to work up enough surprises and rarities for fans who have seen him hundreds of times; and, especially, to pace the show from frenzy to calm and back again. In the past several years, Springsteen has been taking requests from the crowd. He has never been stumped. “You can take the band out of the bar, but you can’t take the bar out of the band,” Van Zandt says.

The E Street Band members are not Springsteen’s equals. “This is not the Beatles,” as Weinberg puts it. They are salaried musicians; in 1989, they were fired en masse. They await his call to record, to tour, to rehearse. And so when Springsteen sprang out of his chair and said, “O.K., time to work,” they straightened up and watched for his cue.

Huh . . . two . . . three . . . four.

As the anthemic opener, “We Take Care of Our Own,” washed over the empty seats, I stood at the back of the hall next to the sound engineer, John Cooper, a rangy, unflappable Hoosier, who was monitoring a vast soundboard and a series of laptops. One hard drive contains the lyrics and keys for hundreds of songs, so that when Springsteen calls for something off the cuff the song quickly appears on TelePrompters within sight of him and his bandmates. (The crutch is hardly unique—Sinatra, in late career, used a TelePrompter, and so do the Stones and many other bands.) Although more than half the show will be the same from night to night, the rest is up for grabs.

“This is about the only live music left, with a few exceptions,” Cooper said. Lip-synchers are legion. Coldplay thickens its sound with heaps of pre-taped instruments and synthesizers. The one artificial sound in Springsteen’s act is a snare-drum sound in “We Take Care of Our Own” that seemed to elude easy reproduction.

That afternoon at Fort Monmouth, Springsteen was intent on nailing “the opening four,” the first songs, which come rapid fire. The band and the crew gave particular attention to those lingering seconds between songs when the keys modulate and the guitar techs pass different instruments to the musicians. It is intricate work; the technicians have to move with the precision of a Daytona pit crew.

Before the tour officially began, in Atlanta, there were a few smaller venues to play, including the Apollo Theatre, in Harlem. There are usually more African-Americans onstage than in the seats, but Springsteen is steeped in black music, and he was especially eager to play the date in Harlem. “All of our teachers stood on those boards at the Apollo,” he said. “The essence of the way this band moves is one of soul. It’s supposed to be overwhelming. You shouldn’t be able to catch your breath. That’s what being a front man is all about—the idea of having something supple underneath you, that machine that roars and can turn on a dime.”

Rock tours generally have a theme: a band’s coltish arrival, a new style or look, a reunion, a new set of songs, a political moment. Springsteen was salting the show with the political material from “Wrecking Ball,” but the most vivid theme on this tour was to be time passing, age, death, and, if Springsteen could manage it, a sense of renewal. The surviving core of the band—Van Zandt, Tallent, Weinberg, Bittan, and Springsteen—had been playing together since the Ford Administration; Lofgren and Patti Scialfa, Springsteen’s wife, who is a singer and guitar player, joined in the eighties.

The run of tragedy, debility, and erosion has seemed relentless in recent years. Nils Lofgren has had both hips replaced, and both his shoulders are a wreck. Max Weinberg has endured open-heart surgery, prostate-cancer treatment, two failed back operations, and seven hand operations. The morning after a concert, he told me, he feels like the Nick Nolte character in the football movie “North Dallas Forty”: bruised and barely able to move. Lofgren has compared the backstage area to “a MASH unit,” with ice packs, heating pads, Bengay tubes, and masseuses on call. More alarmingly, Jon Landau, Springsteen’s manager and closest friend, was recovering from brain surgery.

There have been deeper, permanent losses. In 2008, Danny Federici, who played organ and accordion with Springsteen for forty years, died of melanoma. Springsteen’s body man on tour, a Special Forces veteran named Terry Magovern, died the year before. Springsteen’s trainer died at the age of forty.

The most shocking loss came last year, when Clarence Clemons, Springsteen’s saxophone player and onstage foil and protector, died of a stroke. Clemons was a colossus—six-four, a former football player. As a musician, he possessed a raspy tone reminiscent of King Curtis. He was not a great improviser, but his solos, painstakingly scripted over long hours in the studio with Springsteen, were set pieces in every show. Then, there was his sheer stage presence. Clemons gave Springsteen a mythic companion who embodied the fraternal spirit of the band. “Standing next to Clarence was like standing next to the baddest ass on the planet,” Springsteen said of him in tribute. “You felt like no matter what the day or the night brought, nothing was going to touch you.”

Clemons’s life style was considerably less disciplined than Springsteen’s, and, in recent years, his body had been breaking down, requiring hip replacements, knee replacements, back surgery. On the last tour, Clemons was driven around the arena tunnels in a golf cart. Onstage, he was spending less time exerting himself on the horn and more time resting on a stool and banging on a tambourine. When he did play, it was clear that he was losing the high notes. After one of his last concerts, he told a friend, “I deserve a God-damned Academy Award.” He said that he felt like Mickey Rourke’s character in “The Wrestler”; he was portraying a powerful figure onstage even as he was falling apart physically.

At the funeral, held in a chapel in Palm Beach, Springsteen paid passionate homage to Clemons, recalling that he had put up with a “world where it still wasn’t so easy to be big and black.” He recalled his friend’s “raunchy mysticism,” his appetites, even his dressing room, which was draped in exotic scarves and dubbed the Temple of Soul: “A visit there was like a trip to a sovereign nation that had just struck huge oil reserves.” At the same time, Springsteen gestured toward Clemons’s erratic family life (he was married five times) and the occasional tensions in their relationship. Speaking to Clemons’s sons, he said, “C lived a life where he did what he wanted to do, and he let the chips, human and otherwise, fall where they may. Like a lot of us, your pop was capable of great magic and also of making quite an amazing mess.”
