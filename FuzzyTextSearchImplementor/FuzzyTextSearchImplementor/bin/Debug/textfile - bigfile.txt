Chapter One: Murder in Irvine

A double killing, a vengeful plan, a wave of fear

Police are baffled by the slaying of a young couple with no known enemies. The more they learn, the more ominous the crime becomes. 



Manhattan Beach
 



The man emerged from a charcoal-gray pickup and approached the hotel check-in counter. He wanted a room and the Internet pass code. He was 6 feet tall, with a weightlifter’s build and military posture. But he could transform his soft, round face into a picture of amiability. He struck the night manager as personable and disarming.

Inside Room 116 of the Hi View Inn & Suites in Manhattan Beach, he stared at his Facebook page and a lifetime’s worth of grudges. It is not clear how long he had labored on the unusual document on the screen.

It was a rambling, free-associating screed in which he asserted firm opinions on politicians, journalists, comedians and television shows. It was a brew of hatreds, a sustained cry of self-pity and self-justification, and a blueprint.

One touch of a button would make it public, once people knew where to look.

It was 1:15 a.m. on Monday, Feb. 4.

Irvine
 



Hours earlier, Irvine Police Det. Victoria Hurtado was crouched in the evening chill, studying an enormous diamond ring on a dead woman’s hand. It was one of her first clues. “This is not a robbery,” she thought.

The victim was in the passenger seat of a white Kia Optima, parked on the rooftop lot of an upmarket condo complex on Scholarship Drive. She was Asian, in a pretty blue dress. Beside her, a young black man was slumped over the steering wheel. Both were riddled with bullets, with fatal shots to the back of their heads.

Stepping carefully amid 14 shell casings scattered on the pavement, Hurtado noticed powder burns around the bullet holes in the windows. It was a close-range ambush, and as cold a scene as the detective had seen in 17 years on the force.

There was no evidence of a fight. It was as if the killer, possessed by an impersonal fury, had not known the victims at all.

Hurtado looked up at the high-rise apartments that towered above the garage. Hundreds of people would have had a plain view of the shooting, if they had peered out their windows. Hundreds should have heard it.

Five floors below, news crews were assembling. Murder was startling news in Irvine, which boasted of being America’s safest midsized city — 65 square miles of gleaming corporate parks and master-planned neighborhoods.

Just after midnight, the department received a call. It was from Randal Quan, a retired Los Angeles Police Department captain. He had seen the news and recognized the condo complex. His 28-year-old daughter, Monica, lived there with her 26-year-old fiance, Keith Lawrence.

Quan had grown increasingly worried. He had been trying to call his daughter. She was not answering. He came to the Irvine police station with his wife and grown son. They were a close family. Detectives led them to a private interview room.

Quan described his daughter. He had seen her earlier that day. She had been wearing a blue dress.



Neither Monica Quan nor Keith Lawrence seemed capable of making an enemy.

He had been a security officer at USC. She had coached women’s basketball at Cal State Fullerton.

A few days earlier, Lawrence had asked her to close her eyes as he led her into their condo. He had arranged rose petals on the carpet in the shape of a heart. He knelt and asked her to marry him.

 

“There’s no one more right for us than each other,” he told her, in a scene captured on tape by her brother. “You are my winning lottery ticket.”

Perhaps because she had grown up as a police captain’s daughter, she was guarded about her personal life, even with the young women she coached. But before a team trip to San Luis Obispo she had displayed the big diamond engagement ring and enjoyed the screams of excitement.

Detectives considered every possible theory. They scoured police logs for reports of road rage, on the chance that an aggrieved driver had followed the young couple home. They talked to neighbors and friends, co-workers and family members.

They asked Randal Quan who might want to hurt his daughter. He had been the first Chinese American captain at the LAPD, and had run a squad targeting Asian gangs. In recent years, he had worked as a lawyer representing cops facing termination.

Did someone hate him enough to do this? Someone he had busted? A disgruntled client?

Quan struggled. He could think of no one. He saw himself as a cop who had been respectful to people he arrested. Even losing clients knew he had fought for them.



No one had heard anything. A police canvas of the condominium complex and surrounding buildings confirmed that baffling fact.

The couple had pulled onto the rooftop during the final dramatic minutes of the Super Bowl, when traffic was light. The entry gate recorded their arrival about 7:30 p.m. But police had not learned about the shootings until 9:10 p.m., when a resident walking to his car spotted a body slumped over the Kia’s steering wheel.
 
Who were they dealing with? A professional hit man? The mob?

How had 14 shots gone unheard? Had everybody been that fixated on the game?

Det. Hurtado would have to wait for ballistics tests to be sure, but she began to suspect that the killer had used a silencer. It was an expensive piece of equipment, the province of Hollywood spies and assassins, not real-world killers.

The possibility carried with it a sense of dread. Who were they dealing with? A professional hit man? The mob?

As the department’s 18-member detective squad scrambled after leads, an investigator visited Cal State Fullerton and found a compelling clue — its significance clear only in hindsight — that someone had been stalking Monica Quan.

A few days earlier, a man had called the athletic department from a blocked number. He said his daughter played for the women’s basketball team, but he was unable to reach her because her cellphone was not working.

He asked for the name of the hotel the team was using during its trip to San Luis Obispo. The request was refused. Would he care to give a callback number? The man hung up.


National City, Calif.
 



About 100 miles south of Irvine, Pedro Ruelas, 32, arrived at Sound Solutions Auto Styling to open for business Monday morning.

Some DUI arrests had cost him his job driving forklifts years back, by his account, and now he worked seven days a week at the small auto-repair lot in downtown National City, a few miles north of the Mexican border. He was the first one in, last one out.

And so, as he did every morning, Ruelas emptied the garbage, wheeling one of the gray trash cans to a small graffiti-scrawled garbage bin in the alley next to the lot.

As he approached the bin, he noticed what looked like police or military equipment lying atop the heap. Most striking was a steel-plated ballistic vest. The shape reminded him of the emblem on Superman's chest.

His first thought was that he might be able to sell the gear. But he reconsidered: The police might want to know about so unusual a find. He flagged down the first cop he saw.


Officer Paul Hernandez pulled on latex gloves and began to look.

One ballistic vest.

Two military-style ammunition cans, each with several hundred bullets.

Two cans of olive-drab spray paint, the kind SWAT members use to camouflage their helmets and rifles.

One military-surplus gasoline container, plastic, empty.

Two mortar-tube containers, empty. One black leather police duty belt, with thigh holsters and an expandable baton.

Two AR-15 magazine pouches.

One dark blue LAPD uniform, extra large.


Watch: Evidence discovered in National City dumpster 

 


“When I looked inside the dumpster, I saw that there was a LAPD uniform that had the nameplate of Dorner on it.”

— National City Police Officer Paul Hernandez

One police officer’s field notebook, with a cover bearing two handwritten names and serial numbers:

DORNER #37381

EVANS #31050

Hernandez placed the gear carefully in his squad car and drove to the station house.

He carried the equipment downstairs to the property room and began labeling the items for storage. Another officer might have simply filed a Found Property report and forgotten about it.

Hernandez feared that another cop had been the victim — that someone had stolen the equipment and dumped it in a panic.

At 10:16 a.m. he told the dispatcher to call the LAPD to run down the names and numbers on the notebook.

The answer came back quickly. There was no Dorner now on the force. But there was an Evans.



In keeping with her prework ritual, Teresa Evans had driven to the beach that Monday morning, drank a leisurely cup of coffee and read the Los Angeles Times on her iPad. She saw a brief story about the double homicide in Irvine.

Evans was 48, with short, dyed blond hair, an 18-year veteran of the LAPD. She was a field sergeant, athletically built but physically unimposing, five feet tall, 115 pounds. On the street, her bulky utility belt made her seem even smaller.

Off duty, she spent much of her time hauling her teenage son and his teammates to soccer practice.

Right now, as she was preparing for her late-morning run on the beach, her phone rang.

“I’m just calling about some property,” Officer Hernandez said.

She listened to the strange account of the discarded items. No, she said, she had not been the victim of a theft.

She heard the name Dorner. Anxiety gripped her.

Christopher Dorner had been her trainee six years ago, she said, a problem cop who had been fired. She had no clue where he was now, or why his gear would be in a National City trash bin.

She and Dorner had shared a patrol car in San Pedro, near the ports. He had been a probationary officer just back from a year overseas with the Navy.

She thought little of his abilities. He was sloppy and ham-fisted. He had accidentally shot himself in the hand at the Police Academy. Once, responding to a “man with a gun” call, he had walked directly toward the suspect without seeking cover.

He told Evans that the LAPD had discriminated against him as a black man, and that he intended to sue. He wept in the patrol car. She saw him as unstable, perpetually angry and frustrated, eager to see racism in every encounter.
 
Dorner was deemed a liar and fired.

After she warned him that he needed to improve his policework, Dorner filed a complaint that she had kicked a handcuffed, mentally ill man in the head and chest during an arrest outside a hotel. During the resulting internal investigation, Evans was put on desk duty and prevented from working overtime or off-duty security jobs. She described the ordeal as a “nightmare.”

The LAPD interviewed hotel employees, who said they had seen none of the alleged kicks. The LAPD found it fatal to Dorner’s credibility that he had waited two weeks after the incident before complaining.

He sat before a Board of Rights hearing in December 2008, accused of making the story up. That session took place on the fifth floor of the Bradbury Building downtown, a place informally called “The Ovens.” It is where, police said, they went to get burned.

Dorner was deemed a liar and fired. Evans knew he held her responsible. She recalled the way he had looked at her during the hearing.

It was not a scowl, not a grimace of anger, but something spookier. Her lawyer described it as the “stare of somebody whose mind is racing 100 miles an hour.”

Armed guards stood watch as Dorner was led from the building.

For the next six months, she had carried her service Glock everywhere. She wore it to the bathroom, to the grocery store, to her son’s soccer games. When she drove home, she circled the block to make sure Dorner wasn’t following her, or waiting to ambush her.

Sooner or later, she believed, he would try to find her.

Evans said goodbye to the National City officer and hung up. She was no longer in the mood for her morning run. She wasn’t sure what to do with the information he had given her, or what it might mean.

She supervised the graveyard shift on Venice Beach that night, the phone call never far from her thoughts.


Point Loma, Calif.
 



“Is anybody going out?”

The man asking the question stood on a weather-beaten old pier at Driscoll’s Wharf, amid the motley fleet of squid and swordfish boats in Point Loma. It was Tuesday morning.

Dockhand Jeremy Smith noticed the stranger’s shaved head, military boots and hulking size, and thought he must be from Naval Base San Diego, a few miles south. He did not look like the ordinary visitor. Big black dude, he thought. That’s way out of place.

Smith, 41, found the stranger friendly and likable.

He did not seem like the hard men he had met during his stints in lockup for DUI arrests, nor like the men he lived with now at a halfway house.

The big stranger gave his name as Mike, and said he would soon be sent to war in Afghanistan. He wanted to get in some fishing first. He was willing to pay $200 to fish in Mexican waters.

 

Smith thought he should help a man heading to war. He led him around the docks, past the stacks of steel-mesh lobster cages and piles of netting, looking for a boat.

Nobody was going out for marlin and swordfish; the water was cold, the fish lethargic. One captain found it odd that a man headed to war would want to spend time fishing, rather than with a woman.

Why not a sport boat? Smith asked the stranger. Why not whale-watching?

“I don’t want to whale-watch,” the stranger replied.

The stranger disappeared and came back with a bag of yellowtail and halibut tacos.

He passed them out to the men on Pier 6 and refused to take their money.

Smith explained that he couldn’t take him out on the water himself, because the terms of his jail release didn’t allow him to leave the harbor. He couldn’t risk being spotted by the Harbor Patrol.

“Nazis,” Smith said.

The stranger sympathized. He had a friend who had been fired from the police force, he said, and he didn’t like cops.


Venice
 



That afternoon, Teresa Evans drove to the LAPD’s Pacific Area station to begin her overnight shift. She suited up and led roll call for the eight officers under her command. She and her crew headed to their cars, preparing their gear.

She overheard a group of cops chatting nearby. The subject was an officer’s upcoming disciplinary hearing. The officer needed strong representation, someone said — a good lawyer like Randal Quan, the former LAPD captain turned attorney.

Quan wouldn’t be available any time soon, another cop said.

“His daughter was murdered.”

The hair prickled on the back of Evans’ neck. She felt vaguely sick.

Until now, she hadn’t known that the young woman shot to death in Irvine two nights ago had been Quan’s daughter.

She remembered that Quan had represented Dorner at his Board of Rights hearing, and she knew that Dorner had blamed everyone involved for his firing, including his lawyer. Was there a connection, somehow, to the stash of Dorner’s gear in the trash bin?

“  This might be crazy.” 
— LAPD Sgt. Teresa Evans

It was a busy night on the Venice beach detail. Fights, drunks, homeless calls. But her mind returned repeatedly to the possibility that Dorner had killed the young Irvine couple.

No, she told herself. It’s too much of a long-shot.

At the station house that night, she paused in her paperwork and told another cop, “Let me run this by you.”

The other cop listened and said, “You’ve got to call.”

By 11:15 p.m. Evans was on the phone with the Irvine Police Department’s watch commander, who called the home of the detective-squad sergeant, who promptly called Evans to hear her story.

“This might be crazy,” she began.



Det. Hurtado arrived at the Irvine station before dawn Wednesday. Her sergeant held out a piece of yellow notebook paper bearing Christopher Dorner’s name.

Hurtado ran it through the databases. He had no criminal record. He was a Navy reservist. He owned a Nissan Titan pickup. He had a house in Las Vegas. He had a mother and sister in La Palma, south of Los Angeles. He owned a lot of guns, including 9-millimeter Glocks. The shell casings at the murder scene had been 9-millimeter.


Watch: No immediate leads in a double homicide 

 


“He had, in a sense, now declared war on law enforcement.”

— Irvine Det. Victoria Hurtado

She sent two detectives to National City to examine Dorner’s gear. They learned that an employee at a second auto shop — just down the alley from the first — had found more of Dorner’s equipment in a trash bin. A SWAT-style helmet. A military-style backpack. A magazine with 9-millimeter bullets.

Detectives located a surveillance camera that showed Dorner pulling into the alley in his Titan early Monday, the morning after the shootings. He could be seen climbing out to toss away the items. He seemed to be in no rush.

He had picked an alley in plain view of the National City police station, as if he had hoped to be spotted and confronted.

Back in Irvine, detectives drafted search warrants for Dorner’s home and his mother’s home. If they found him, they were intent on taking him in. But they were not sure they had enough to charge him with murder.

They sought a stopgap measure, to hold him as the case was being built. They found it in the expandable baton Dorner had cast away. He could be charged with possession of a prohibited weapon. When he lost his badge, he had lost his right to carry it.

Hurtado placed calls to the LAPD, trying to find Dorner’s personnel file. She kept getting voice mails. People were out of the office, or on vacation.

She left her call-back number, and tried to keep the details vague. She had no contacts at the LAPD; as far as she knew, Dorner might still have friends there. If she didn’t proceed cautiously, someone might alert him to her interest.

Then she called Randal Quan, and asked:

Does the name Christopher Dorner mean anything to you?

“  This is a necessary evil that I do not enjoy but must partake and complete... ” 
— Christopher Dorner

She heard silence. Then she heard him gasp and say, “Oh my God. That guy’s crazy.”

Quan explained that he had represented Dorner at his Board of Rights hearing. He said Dorner had blamed him for his firing and was a man obsessed with the concept of his own integrity. He possessed “kind of a hero syndrome,” Quan said.

In her notebook, the detective wrote:

“Hero syndrome.”

Hurtado called one of the slain couple’s friends. During the conversation, an email arrived on her desktop computer. It was from a detective down the hall conducting a Web search. It had a link to Dorner’s Facebook page.

“From: Christopher Jordan Dorner

“To: America

“Subj: Last resort


Read Dorner’s manifesto »
  
“I know most of you who personally know me are in disbelief to hear from media reports that I am suspected of committing such horrendous murders and have taken drastic and shocking actions in the last couple of days,” the posting began.

“Unfortunately, this is a necessary evil that I do not enjoy but must partake and complete for substantial change to occur within the LAPD and reclaim my name. The department has not changed since the Rampart and Rodney King days. It has gotten worse....”

It was 1:59 p.m., Wednesday, Feb. 6. Hurtado hung up and called Quan to tell him he was in danger.

Dozens of detectives were getting the same email, reading it on desktops and smartphones. Down the hall, Irvine’s police chief was meeting with his command staff. The detective sergeant ran over and stuck his head in.

“I need some help,” he said.

Chapter Two: Fear and the City

A deadly threat ripples through the LAPD

By Christopher Goffard, Joel Rubin and Kurt Streeter

Illustrations by Doug Stevens

December 10, 2013


Officers rush to protect targets of Christopher Dorner’s vendetta. His former training officer, guarded at home, fears for her life.



Los Angeles
 



Just after 2 p.m. at the LAPD’s sleek, 10-story glass tower, the phones began beeping furiously.

Police in Irvine, an hour south, had alerted their Los Angeles counterparts to a terrifying Facebook post. Its author, a disgraced LAPD patrolman, had vowed to murder his former colleagues en masse.

His targets ran through the ranks. Patrol officers were targets. Sergeants were targets. Captains were targets. The chief was a target. Families were targets.

It was Wednesday, Feb. 6. An impromptu war room sprang up on the fifth floor of LAPD’s downtown headquarters. Detectives in the robbery-homicide squad tore through Christopher Dorner’s online tirade and tallied the names on a white board. They quickly counted 30 people who needed protection.

Sirens screamed across freeways in every direction. About 200 cops went in the first wave of protection details. Specialized units were the easiest to mobilize, so gang squads went. Vice squads went. Twenty off-duty cops from the elite Metro division went. Ordinary patrol cops went.

The potential victims were scattered across thousands of square miles — across L.A. County’s far-flung suburbs, from its northern edge to deep inside Orange County, from the beach cities in the west to Riverside County in the east.

Every target would get a “scarecrow” detail: At least two cops, uniformed and visible. There was no time to ask permission of the many local police agencies whose territories the LAPD would be entering, no time to debate or negotiate.

Get there! commanders barked into radios and cellphones. Go! We’ll clean it up later!



Dorner’s 11,000-word document, which people began calling “the manifesto,” was all at once a confession, an extended threat and a summing-up of the life its 33-year-old author soon expected to depart.

It was an open letter to America, and a ramble through pop culture, politics and personal grievance.

How accurately the document reflected the facts of his life is unclear. But it vividly illustrated how he perceived his life. He was a prideful man who believed the world had failed to recognize his great gifts. Victimhood was his singular theme.

No one grows up and wants to be a cop killer, he wrote. It was against everything I’ve ever been....

 

Dorner was raised in a series of middle-class cities where, as one of the few black kids, he felt like an outsider: Cerritos, Pico Rivera, La Palma, Thousand Oaks. His mother was a nurse. His father was absent.

In first grade at Norwalk Christian School, he wrote, the principal swatted him for punching a student who had taunted him with a racial slur. The swattings from authority figures continued through junior high, he claimed, when he dared to stand up to bigots.

When he arrived at the LAPD, he wrote, he found it a nest of racists. In the Police Academy, he complained about another recruit’s use of a racial slur and was shunned. On patrol with the LAPD, he complained that his training officer had kicked a mentally ill man, and in response the department conspired to destroy him. He had dared, he said, to violate the Code of Silence.

He vowed to hunt members of the Board of Rights who had heard his case. He would hunt the LAPD hierarchy that had sanctioned his punishment. He was convinced that his former lawyer, Randal Quan, had been loyal to the LAPD rather than to him. He would hunt him and his loved ones.

I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own, I’m terminating yours...

He bragged of his marksmanship and tactical prowess. He would kill Caucasian officers who victimized minorities. He would kill black officers who belittled their Caucasian subordinates and fueled anti-black bigotry. He would kill Latino officers who victimized other Latinos. He would kill lesbian officers who degraded men.

He praised his knee surgeon, President Obama, the first lady’s hairstyle, George W. Bush, Charlie Sheen, Chick-fil-A chicken and Bill Cosby. He told Gov. Chris Christie to go on a diet, and told David Petraeus that his marital failings were human. He told Natalie Portman she was beautiful. He quoted Mia Farrow on the moral urgency of gun control.

He knew he would die, and lamented what he would not get to see. He would miss “The Hangover III,” and told the director not to diminish the franchise with another sequel. He would miss season three of “The Walking Dead.” He would miss Shark Week.



From his 10th-floor office, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck was trying to coordinate the agency’s response and keep his family safe. He called his wife and told her to assemble the family at home, fast.

“He has a vendetta list,” he said. “We’re on it.”

Beck had not been chief when Dorner was fired, but he was the public face of the department. Two of Beck’s kids wore LAPD badges. He ordered them pulled off duty.

Chief Beck, Dorner had written, this is when you need to have that come to Jesus talk with Sgt. Teresa Evans and everyone else who was involved in the conspiracy to have me terminated for doing the right thing....

“  He has a vendetta list. We’re on it.” 
— LAPD Chief Charlie Beck

Studying Dorner’s words, Beck thought, “He’s an injustice collector.” He blamed everyone else for his failures.

Beck was struck by the length of the tirade. This was no fleeting howl of homicidal rage but the chilling product, it seemed, of months-long planning and forethought.

Dorner had invoked the most highly charged controversies of the LAPD’s past. The beating of Rodney King. The Rampart scandal. The specter of Mark Fuhrman.

As chief for more than three years, Beck had helped to transform the 10,000-officer department. In black neighborhoods, its image as an occupying army had abated. Its 11% of black officers now roughly mirrored the city’s demographics.

Yet Beck understood, even at a glance, the combustible elements at play. True or false, Dorner’s accusations would resonate with people predisposed to believe them. And so today the chief turned to his media spokesman and asked:

“Is this the thing?”
 
If the public turned against the LAPD in the days ahead, Beck knew, he would have to take the blame himself.

He did not need to explain. He meant the thing that spiraled out of control so badly that it forced him from his job. He reckoned the odds at 50-50 that it would happen someday.

Everyone who served as chief in the nation’s second-largest city woke up knowing today might be the day.

Beck sometimes wondered what his predecessor, Daryl F. Gates, had thought on first viewing the grainy footage of his white officers beating Rodney King. Beck had been a sergeant on the front lines in 1992 when the cops were acquitted and rioting swept the city.

Gates had been untouchable. Then he was gone.

Now, a man the LAPD had trained was promising to bring war to its doorstep. If the public turned against the LAPD in the days ahead, Beck knew, he would have to take the blame himself.

“None of us bury our past,” he would say. “You don’t bury it. You carry it.” 



Teresa Evans, Dorner’s former training officer, was sitting in her SUV when she got the call. She was outside her home in a Los Angeles suburb, about to leave for her son’s soccer game.

“It’s a credible threat,” an Irvine sergeant was telling her.

She looked around quickly. Would Dorner be coming around the corner, gun blazing? It would be easy for him to find her here. She had to get away, fast.

Her cellphone rang again. Two LAPD captains told her they were sending protection to meet her, and would call her back with a rendezvous point.

“Stay mobile,” they said. “Don’t go home.”

She drove to the soccer field. There, she met her ex-husband and explained. He would watch their son for now. She hoped that if Dorner came, he would come only after her.
 
She still did not feel safe. She feared that Dorner might take aim from a freeway visible from her window.

Back on the road, she checked the mirrors constantly. She recalled Dorner bragging about his experience in military intelligence. Was he monitoring her phone’s GPS? She flipped abrupt U-turns. She pulled onto the freeway, pulled off, pulled on.

She steered with her left hand, so her right could quickly grab her duty Glock, squeezed in its holster between the driver’s seat and the center console.

She called a hotel in Orange County and booked a room. She headed that way.

Her phone rang again. A security team would meet her in a church parking lot near her home.

She drove to the meeting point, but there were no officers in sight. She waited nearby, her gun close.

Then help came screaming down the block, a pack of patrol cars — 10 or more, she guessed — roaring her way.


Soon there were cops with assault rifles in Teresa Evans’ living room, in her kitchen, ringing her house. They drew the curtains and covered the windows with blankets. They shoved the couch against the window of her son’s room, unscrewed the porch lights and deactivated the motion sensors.

She still did not feel safe. She feared that Dorner might take aim from a freeway visible from her window.

You destroyed my life and name because of your actions, he had written. Time is up.

She dumped her Facebook page. She turned off her phone’s GPS tracker.

When her son came hobbling through the door, his ankle injured during the afternoon’s soccer game, she tried to explain the presence of the SWAT team in vague terms.

Something is going on, she said, and everything will be OK.

She did not say, “Someone wants to murder us.”



People who had known Dorner for years were shocked to see his smiling face on fliers and television screens. One of them was a San Diego police officer named Dulani Jackson. He had been friends with Dorner since they had attended Cypress High School.

Jackson, who is also black, said Dorner had complained about being bullied by racists at his former high school in La Palma. Dorner liked to say that if a girl disrespected him, he would beat up her boyfriend. Or take it out on her family.

After Dorner’s firing from the LAPD in 2009, Jackson had driven to Dorner’s home in Vegas to keep him company. He found him in a deep depression. Dorner blamed the LAPD for tarnishing his name and thereby sabotaging his career in the Navy. Only two days before the Irvine killings, the Navy had officially discharged him.

Dorner had abruptly cut Jackson out of his life, with a text citing a litany of long-simmering grievances. He resented that Jackson hadn’t attended his graduation from Southern Utah University. He resented that Jackson hadn’t visited him in the hospital, after he shot himself in the hand in the Police Academy.

Jackson could picture Dorner alone in his Vegas home, isolated from family, cut off from friends, with nothing to do but seethe. He knew that Dorner had started buying silencers about a year ago. That, he reasoned, was probably when he began to plan his murder campaign.

Like Jackson, many who knew Dorner understood that his memory for slights — real or imagined — was vast. He was always adding up the score.

A former girlfriend, Denise Jensen, remembered that he had been a perfect gentleman at first. He liked to open doors for her. He bought her a nice watch and an iPod. In a tantrum, he seized the gifts and gave them to a stranger at a gas station. Worthier of my kindness, he explained.

He made friends effortlessly but turned on them in an instant. “You just don’t know until he starts turning,” Jensen said.

In July 2009, months after their breakup, Dorner logged onto Facebook and used a fake name — “Mike Crawford” — to lure her to a date at a Las Vegas restaurant. He cornered her in the ladies room and left only after staff threatened to call police.

Another ex-girlfriend had posted a warning on the website Don’tDateHimGirl.com, saying: “If you value your sanity, stay away from this guy.” She described him as “super paranoid always thinking somebody’s out to get him.”

When people asked Dorner about the multitude of firearms he kept close at hand, he would reply that trouble might come any time. J’Anna Hendricks, a manicurist who briefly rented a room from him, discovered guns hidden in the couch cushions.

At first, she found him a model of friendliness. He took her to dinner. She was white, and he jokingly called her a cracker. She called him a wheat cracker and said he was the whitest black guy she knew. She thought it was good fun, though she sensed it annoyed him.

One day he invited her to his room and displayed his laptop. On it were naked photos of himself and some of his girlfriends. He seemed to be testing whether she would sleep with him. She left the room fast. Soon afterward, Dorner stormed into her room and screamed, “I want you out tonight!”

In recent months, Dorner had frequented the Lahaina Grill on the outskirts of Vegas, a dimly lit restaurant where he sat with his back against the wall. He drank bottled water and ate sushi, sharing YouTube clips on his MacBook with other patrons and holding forth on politics.

He said he favored background checks for assault-rifle purchasers, including cops. “Hey,” he told a bartender, “we can snap.”


San Diego
 



On Wednesday night, not far from the wharf where he had been trying to charter a boat to Mexican waters, the fugitive walked onto the docks of the Southwestern Yacht Club in San Diego.

The ungated club was at the end of an out-of-the-way, affluent neighborhood. A yacht called Vivere II was moored in slip A20.

Inside, the 81-year-old owner, Carlos Caprioglio, was watching television. He would later tell police that he heard footsteps but was not automatically alarmed. He assumed it was his wife, returning from a trip to Los Angeles.

Then Dorner was there, pointing a black semiautomatic handgun at him. “I don’t want to kill you,” he said, “but you’re gonna take me to Mexico.”

Dorner took hold of the rope that moored the boat to the dock. A boater of even casual experience knew to throw the rope onto the dock. Instead, Dorner threw it into the water.

Dorner ordered Caprioglio to start the boat. The rope became entangled in the prop. They weren’t going anywhere. It seemed to dawn on Dorner that he had botched his plan.

“Take my car keys,” Caprioglio said. “Take my car.”

“I don’t want to be on the streets,” Dorner said.

He found a pair of Caprioglio’s shoes, and removed the laces. He ordered him to lie face-down, with his right cheek pressed to the sun deck. He tied his hands and feet with the laces, stole his cellphone and disappeared.

By the time Caprioglio had freed himself and had summoned help, just before 10 p.m, Dorner was gone.


Los Angeles
 



With SWAT troops sitting in her darkened living room drinking soda, Teresa Evans crawled under her bedcovers Wednesday night. She thought this would prevent Dorner from seeing the glow of her iPhone — just in case he was out there, watching and waiting for his shot.

“He’s going to shoot me through my window and kill me,” she kept thinking.

All night she traded texts with cops and friends, searching for any scrap of news. She knew she wouldn’t sleep.

Her son was down the hall. To make things easier on him, she had assured him: “It’s going to be over by tomorrow.”

This was a mistake she would make more than once.

Chapter Three: Longest Night

On a night of fear, violent ambushes in the streets

By Christopher Goffard, Louis Sahagun, Kurt Streeter and Phil Willon

December 12, 2013


In Corona and Riverside, Christopher Dorner fires on police. At 4 a.m., a doorbell awakens a wife. In Torrance, cops make potentially lethal mistakes.

 

Riverside
 



Michael Crain’s wife demanded one thing of him, whenever he put on his uniform, secured his badge on his chest and patrolled the streets of Riverside overnight.

He had to text her that he was OK. If she woke she could glance at her phone and take reassurance. He thought the ritual was silly, because he might run into trouble five minutes later, but he did it anyway.

On the night of Wednesday, Feb. 6, as he did before every shift, Crain, 34, took pains to shed every vestige of his non-cop identity. He made sure there were no family photos in his wallet, in case it flopped open in a chase. He took off his wedding ring and put it on his nightstand.

In the streets, it was best to be a man without vulnerabilities.

Suspects would see a muscular, buzz-cut, 6-foot-3 ex-Marine. Not a father who coached his 10-year-old son’s baseball team, made his 4-year-old daughter breakfast every morning and learned to tie her ponytail. Not a man who liked the Food Network, Lynyrd Skynyrd and wearing zebra-striped platform shoes to disco parties.

A suspect had tried to follow him home once. This was safer.

Regina Crain had guessed he was ex-military the day they met, from the way he held out his chest and kept his hair high-and-tight. He had left the Marines before 9/11 and felt guilty he hadn’t stayed to fight, but she was glad he had avoided war. Her first husband had fought in Fallujah, and she had seen too many military funerals.

Tonight, she watched him pack his duffel bag for work — backup gun, badge clip, loose change, hair gel, boot polish, Tums. She knew that he liked the graveyard shift, because it was rarely dull, and that he would be disappointed if he came home saying, “I didn’t find any bad guys.”

 

Tonight was his last shift with an officer he was training named Andrew Tachias, and he had reassured her that he was an alert, safety-conscious cop. “He’s good to go,” he said. “I’m basically just teaching him paperwork.”

She stood on the stairway step, to reach him, and kissed him and told him to hurry home. They were approaching their second wedding anniversary. She knew he liked to get to work an hour before his 10 p.m. roll call, so he could dress at his locker and practice quick-drawing his gun.

A fanatic for safety, Michael Crain lectured his family never to leave a purse or a Gameboy in the car in plain view. At the mall, his kids knew to avoid his gun-hand side, in case the wrong person recognized him.

Before she went to sleep that night, Regina Crain checked her Facebook page. She saw that police were chasing someone named Christopher Dorner, an ex-LAPD officer who had vowed revenge against his former agency and had killed two people in Irvine.

She didn’t think much about it. Los Angeles was a full hour’s drive west.

At 11:43 p.m. she texted her husband: “Good night sexy man!”

She knew that if she woke up in the middle of the night, his reply would be waiting for her, assuring her he was OK.
 

Corona, Calif.
 



In the small hours of that Thursday morning, a self-employed repo man stricken with bladder cancer was beginning work about an hour east of L.A.

Lee McDaniel, 49, the son of a retired Cleveland cop, had just left the side of his sleeping wife. Now he pulled his big Chevrolet truck up to a pump at the Arco station on Weirick Road in Corona.

Since the cancer had invaded his cells, he often felt weak, but he was determined not to lie on the couch and wither away. Work kept him busy and got his mind off his illness.

His first eight-hour chemotherapy session was to begin later that morning. He was on the road now because he wanted to exhaust himself, in order to sleep soundly as the machine pumped poison into his arm.

But first he had a few hours’ work to get through, so he activated the gas pump and let it run as he walked into the AM/PM minimart to buy bottles of 5-Hour Energy. Standing in line at the counter, he felt what he described as a “hulking presence” come up behind him.

He turned. The man behind him was as big as a linebacker. They exchanged a quick look. McDaniel thought he looked vaguely familiar — maybe a neighbor, maybe someone he knew from years of coaching Little League.

McDaniel walked back to his truck, holstered the pump and slid behind the wheel. He was pulling past the door of the minimart just as the large man emerged, walking in front of the truck.

Mounted on the hood of McDaniel’s truck were four license plate recognition cameras with telltale lights, the kind police use to track down stolen cars and repo men use to find cars to repossess. He saw the big man notice them.
 
Now, he noticed Dorner watching him, standing at the Titan’s open door, holding something McDaniel couldn’t see.

Their eyes locked. McDaniel saw the man walk toward a charcoal-gray Nissan Titan at one of the pumps. It had a roof rack, aftermarket black rims and tinted windows.

McDaniel had seen the news. He knew Christopher Dorner was driving a Titan.

McDaniel was unarmed but accustomed to confrontations and able to function under stress. He pulled slowly past the Titan, and stuck his head out the window to get a look at the license plate. It started with an 8.

He remembered that Dorner’s plate started with a 7, according to police. His truck was also supposed to be blue, and this one was gray.

McDaniel stopped his truck at the edge of the lot, close enough to escape down the street if the Titan owner pulled a gun. On his smartphone, he brought up a story about Dorner and found the plate police were distributing: 7X03191.

He typed it into his laptop, running it through a plate database. Up came a photo of a gray Nissan Titan. Roof rack, cover. It was the truck at the pump behind him.

The police had the color wrong, and McDaniel assumed Dorner had switched plates.

Now, he noticed Dorner watching him, standing at the Titan’s open door, holding something McDaniel couldn’t see.

McDaniel pulled onto Weirick Road. He made a U-turn. He parked across the street from the gas station.

He thought Dorner might follow him. Instead, Dorner turned right out of the station, hooked another quick right and disappeared.

McDaniel was trying to call police when he saw an LAPD patrol car pull off Interstate 15 and head into the gas station. He flashed his lights, to signal them, and drove over the median to meet them.

The officers were in Corona to protect one of Dorner’s targets. The guy you’re looking for was just here, McDaniel said.
 
Dorner was about 100 feet away, with firepower that vastly overwhelmed them. 

At that moment, the Titan reappeared. Dorner drove past the gas station and pulled onto a freeway on-ramp.

“That’s him,” McDaniel said.

McDaniel saw one of the officers drop his notebook and radio as he hurried to the patrol car. McDaniel picked them up and tossed them into the police car.

The officers followed Dorner onto Interstate 15, heading north, hanging back a safe distance. They were trying to confirm it was Dorner’s truck.

Five miles along, the patrol car followed Dorner down the Magnolia Avenue offramp to the street. Dorner was waiting at the curb beside his parked truck. He opened fire with his assault rifle, riddling the patrol car with .223-caliber rounds.

The officers ducked. They tried to fire back with their handguns, futilely. Dorner was about 100 feet away, with firepower that vastly overwhelmed them. His rounds pierced the squad car’s windshield, punctured a tire, blew out the radiator. It was immobilized in seconds. One bullet grazed an officer’s head. Dorner sped away down Magnolia.

The officers’ radios were out of LAPD broadcast range. They had to rely on cellphones, one of them borrowed from a passing motorist. The delay probably cost minutes in sending a warning.

The 911 call went in at 1:24 a.m.
 

Riverside
 



About 10 miles east, Michael Crain and his trainee, Andrew Tachias, were sitting at a red light in their Riverside Police Department patrol car. It was foggy at the intersection of Magnolia and Arlington avenues.

They had ridden together a month, and shared an easy camaraderie. Tachias had plans to marry. His father was an L.A. County sheriff’s deputy, who had excited his son’s boyhood imagination with stories of the job and then tried to talk him out of wearing a badge because of the toll it took on a man’s personal life.

Tachias’ favorite film was “End of Watch,” a violent, harrowing cop drama about a pair of L.A. cops on the job. He watched it before shifts, to psych himself up.

Tonight, Tachias was in the driver’s seat, Crain in the passenger seat. To their left, also stopped at the red light, a 42-year-old Riverside man sat in a Chevrolet Cavalier with flaking paint and missing hubcaps. He was a food-truck driver returning home from work. He glanced at Tachias, who smiled, looking like a man who loved his job.

It was just after 1:30 a.m. Inside the squad car, the radio crackled with news: Dorner was in the area and headed their way.

Parked at the red light, on the other side of the intersection, a 33-year-old man named Karam Kaoud was sitting alone inside a white Crown Victoria with the words BELL CAB CO. on the door.

A Palestinian raised in Dubai, Kaoud had been an American citizen for four months and driving a cab for six. He had a degree in mechanical engineering from Cal State Northridge, but couldn’t find work in the field.

So he put in 15-hour shifts in his father’s cab, often covering 400 miles across Riverside and San Bernardino counties. It was supposed to be temporary.

His father worried about graveyard-shift muggers and crazies. He had called this morning and said, “Please be careful.”

“Inshallah,” Kaoud had replied. God willing. “Don’t worry, Dad.”

A devout Muslim, the cabbie kept the Koran in the glovebox and prayed five times a day. When he couldn’t get to the mosque, he removed the car’s floor mat and flipped it over on the pavement of a quiet parking lot. Then he knelt, a smartphone app pointing him to Mecca.

He lived with his wife, parents, two sisters and his four-month-old son. He had just dropped off a customer at a Denny’s and decided to head to a downtown Riverside restaurant to wait for fares.

As he pulled out of the restaurant parking lot onto Madison Street, he debated which way to go. It made sense to turn right, which would take him to the 91 Freeway and get him there fast. It didn’t make sense to turn left, because the stoplights on Magnolia might cost him three extra minutes.

For reasons he couldn’t explain, he had turned left. That is why he was here at this hour, facing a Riverside police car across an intersection.

He noticed Officer Crain sitting bolt-straight in the passenger seat, completely still.

He was preoccupied with his GPS when he half-noticed the Nissan Titan pulling up on his right. Then he saw the Titan moving forward, as if the light had turned green.

Reflexively, he took his foot off the brake and began to follow. Then he stopped. The light was still red. He watched the Titan cross the intersection and pull up beside the food-truck driver’s Cavalier and the patrol car. At first, he did not understand what he was seeing.

He watched the cold air warped by the heat from a rifle muzzle, just outside the open window of the Titan’s driver’s-side window. The driver was firing over the hood of the Cavalier at the patrol car, in quick, muted bursts.

Within seconds, the Titan was pulling away down Magnolia.

The bullet-riddled patrol car rolled slowly into the intersection.

The cabbie jumped out. Inside the patrol car, he saw the wide-open eyes of Officer Tachias as he sat paralyzed behind the wheel, struggling to breathe, his foot off the brake. He noticed Officer Crain sitting bolt-straight in the passenger seat, completely still.

The cabbie had not heard the name Dorner, and he avoided trouble. He did not know if he could touch a police car; he might be sued. Still, he reached into the car and forced the gear shift into park, producing a grating sound as the car stopped.

He touched Tachias’ shoulder and asked what he could do.

“The radio,” the policeman managed to say. “The radio.”

The cabbie reached for the walkie-talkie at Tachias’ side.

“The other radio,” the policeman said. He meant the walkie-talkie on the dashboard.

The cabbie grabbed it. He pushed the button on the side. He held it to Tachias’ lips. Tachias struggled to form the words.

“Officer down,” he said. He looked at his motionless partner.

The cabbie knew how to work the radio, because he had one just like it, but in his fear his finger was frozen on the button. His eyes darted around the streets. What if the shooter returned? What if there was more than one of them? He noticed the gun on the policeman’s belt. He might have to grab it to defend himself.

“Release your hand,” Tachias said.

He obeyed. A dispatcher said help was on its way.

The cabbie looked at Tachias and knew he was dying. He told him to hang on. He saw the lights of a police car, speeding toward him on Magnolia. He held his hands in the air to show he was unarmed.
 
He noticed Dorner had been wearing a heavy camouflage jacket and wraparound goggles. It looked like he had been grinning.

He saw two policemen staring in at Crain, then exchanging a look that told him the officer was dead. He saw rescuers pull Tachias onto the ground and heard him say “I’m cold, I’m losing my breath,” while a policeman said, “Keep talking to him.”

Judging from the .223-caliber casings found at the scene, Dorner had fired at least 13 times with his armor-piercing assault rifle. Both officers were rushed to Riverside Community Hospital. Tachias slipped in and out of consciousness. Bullets had struck him in the back, legs and arms, blowing out his shoulder.

Crain had no pulse. Rescuers worked on him frantically for half an hour before pronouncing him dead, but he had probably died right away.

Seven rounds had struck him. They grazed his head, hit his shoulder and thigh, and severed his jugular vein.

One bullet had pierced his badge, ripped through his ballistic vest, and punctured his heart. He had not drawn his gun.

Dorner had disappeared again. The Cavalier driver, Jack Chilson, had tried to pursue him but had grown afraid and stopped.

From just feet away, he had seen Dorner firing at the patrol car. He had seen the bullets punch a circle in the window the size of a paper plate.

He noticed Dorner had been wearing a heavy camouflage jacket and wraparound goggles. It looked like he had been grinning.
 

San Diego
 



About 40 minutes after the shooting, a shuttle driver near San Diego International Airport saw a wallet in the road and stopped to pick it up. Inside was a photo ID of Dorner and an LAPD detective’s badge.

The badge turned out to be real, but it was not Dorner’s. He had never been a detective.
 
 Was he playing some kind of game, taunting police with scattered clues? 

Share this excerpt

The detective who had earned it was dead; the widow could not recall how it had vanished.

Police guessed that Dorner had probably purchased it from a police-memorabilia dealer, and had used it to masquerade as a detective.

Why had Dorner dumped the wallet here, on a well-traveled route where it was likely to be spotted? Did he want them to believe he had flown out of town?

Why, soon after his first killings, had he dumped his police and paramilitary gear in two National City trash bins? Had he been scuttling possessions in hopes of fleeing the country? Or was he playing some kind of game, taunting police with scattered clues?
 

Torrance
 



About 5 a.m. Thursday, three and a half hours after the shooting, about 60 miles west of Riverside, an aluminum blue Toyota Tacoma rolled slowly down a wide, well-lit street in Torrance.

In the back seat was Emma Hernandez, 71, who was handing copies of the Los Angeles Times and Wall Street Journal to her daughter, Margie Carranza, 46, who was driving with one hand and tossing papers onto porches with the other.

They were both small women, the mother under five feet tall, the daughter just a little taller. They were from El Salvador and spoke little English.

They had risen that morning in a Torrance tenement with a graffiti-scratched elevator. Hernandez shared the single bedroom with her granddaughter; Carranza slept in the living room near her teenage son.

The women were squirreling away money so that the boy could afford college. They did the two- and-a-half-hour shift seven days a week, 365 days a year, and held down separate jobs as housecleaners.

They drove to the newspaper distribution center to pick up their stack of 400 papers, and began their route. Their custom was to drive with headlights and hazard lights on.

The daughter noticed a police car parked at the corner of Redbeam Avenue and Norton Street, all four doors open, with no officers in sight. She was apprehensive. She never saw police here.

The women did not know that a team of LAPD officers was on the block guarding the house of a captain who had been targeted in Dorner’s manifesto. The police also had just received a radio call that a truck resembling Dorner’s had left the freeway and was headed their way.

The daughter told her mother to stand beside her, fearing they would now be executed.

The truck windows were open, and yet the women heard no orders to stop, no commands to surrender. They heard only the sound of gunfire exploding through the truck.

Glass shattered, and the air filled with splinters of plastic. Bullets flew through the seats, the headrest, the glass. “I am just the newspaper woman!” the daughter yelled, but the shots kept coming.

In the back seat, the mother saw her daughter’s head sway from side to side, and feared she would be shot in the head. “No tengas miedo!” she cried. Don’t be afraid.

She hugged the back of her daughter’s seat, to shield her from the barrage of bullets. She did not want her grandchildren to lose their mother. “God have mercy on our souls!” she said.

One bullet went in high on the right side of her back, and emerged just above the collarbone. Another bullet struck her lower back, close to the spine. A small fragment of glass flew into her eye.

Neither woman could tell how long the shooting lasted. By one estimate, police officers — eight of them — fired more than 100 rounds, and 30 of them missed the truck altogether.

Police yelled at the women to get out with their hands up. The terrified women emerged. The daughter told her mother to stand beside her, fearing they would now be executed.


The police looked at the women and seemed to realize their mistake.

“Why did you shoot at us?” the daughter asked. They heard no explanation, no apology.

The mother was able to stand, but she felt blood pouring down her back. “I’m hurt, I’m hurt,” she said. She wondered why police did not inspect her wounds or render first aid.

When an ambulance arrived, she bickered with paramedics who wanted to remove her shirt. Her daughter told her it was necessary.

Neighbors had been awakened by the gunfire, and some had crawled to their windows to peek outside. Bullets had sprayed cars and houses, roofs, garage doors, trees, windshields, bumpers, front doors.
 
“  Why did you shoot at us?” 
— Margie Carranza

One man heard bullets striking his front door, groped for the phone and demanded the police. The dispatcher said: They are already there.

One man found five bullet holes in the entryway to his house and voiced a common sense of bafflement. “How do you mistake two Hispanic women, one who is 71, for a large black male?”

Only a few blocks away, Torrance police had stopped a black Honda Ridgeline pickup truck. The driver, David Perdue, was a 38-year-old baggage handler at LAX. He was going to pick up a friend for a morning of surfing.

Police questioned him and told him to turn around. As he was driving away, another Torrance police car raced up and broadsided him. His airbags exploded. An officer began firing at him. Three bullets flew through his windshield but missed him. He was ordered to the pavement at gunpoint. He would complain of a concussion, spine trouble and pain that left him unable to work or lift his kids.

A white man of medium height and build, he looked nothing like Christopher Dorner.

In their attempt at an explanation, Torrance police said its officers had been responding to the shots fired by the LAPD nearby. They had perceived the surfer as a threat.
 

Riverside
 



Regina Crain had a nightmare once, after one of her husband’s colleagues on the Riverside Police Department had been killed on the job.

In the dream, she was with her husband in the kitchen, and he said, “You can’t keep doing this, Gina,” and she suddenly knew he was a ghost conjured from her longing. She woke up screaming and turned on the lights so she could see that he was alive.

“A cop-wife dream,” she called it.

Now the doorbell rang. She went down the stairs. Voodoo, her labrador, and Pandora, her Rottweiler, were barking madly, ready to maul whoever was at the door at 4 a.m.

When her first husband was away fighting in Fallujah, she had come to dread late-night visits. She knew what they meant. She had been to dozens of Marine funerals. She had once watched a casualty-notification team walk up to a neighbor’s house.

As she walked to the front door, she hoped the neighborhood was on fire. An evacuation order. Anything.

She looked through the peephole and saw a police shield and she knew.

She opened the door and saw one of her husband’s friends, a sergeant. The Riverside chief was standing behind him. She told them it was a dream. She tried to close the door on them. The sergeant put out his hand and said, “No, Gina, it’s real.”

He asked her to put away the dogs. She took the dogs upstairs and came back down and let the police officers in. She demanded that they say her husband was fine, he was hurt and in the hospital but fine.

No.

Did he suffer?

No. It was quick.

Suddenly she remembered her phone. She raced upstairs and grabbed it. Michael Crain had sent his last text at 1:09 a.m., 25 minutes before he was shot. He had been thinking of her.

There was only one word:

“Night.”

Chapter Four: A Killer Vanishes

Charred truck on icy road draws pursuers to Big Bear

By Christopher Goffard, Joel Rubin and Louis Sahagun

Illustrations by Doug Stevens

December 13, 2013


One resident reports seeing the elusive Christopher Dorner, who some are beginning to view as a folk hero.

 

San Bernardino
 



Det. Alex Collins was up early, with his wife and new baby, and found one story dominating the news. The reports made clear that Christopher Dorner was no longer hunting just the network of people he blamed for his firing from the LAPD. Fleeing east out of L.A. County, he was shooting anyone with a badge.

Collins was a boyish-looking 26 with an air of earnest innocence. He had married his high school sweetheart. He was the youngest of three brothers, and had followed both of them into the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.

Now, Collins thought of the suicides he had seen during his years patrolling Big Bear. People sought out the isolation of the mountains to end their lives. He wondered if that might be Dorner’s plan.

It was Thursday, Feb. 7. Collins wasn’t supposed to be working. He had been on leave for two and a half weeks, for his son’s birth. His hair was longer than he liked it, and he had grown a beard.

It was still morning when his phone rang. It was his oldest brother, a patrol sergeant in Big Bear. He had information that had not yet made the news.

“Hey, I think we found Dorner’s truck,” he whispered. He was calling from an ice-covered mountain road where an abandoned Nissan Titan sat charred and smoldering.

Collins felt the impulse to go in. He called his other brother, who was on the SWAT team. Over the phone, he could hear him flooring his accelerator as he raced up the mountain.

Collins shaved. He put on his suit and tie.

His mom called to check on the baby. He told her he was going to follow his brothers up the mountain. He would not be able to live with himself if one of them got hurt and he was not there to help.

She sounded nervous. All three of her sons would be hunting a cop killer.

“I gotta go,” he said.


Big Bear Lake
 



The lock on the gate of Forest Service Road 2N10 had been snipped with bolt cutters. It lay in the snow.

The road started at an altitude of 7,000 feet and wound steeply up a mountain, parallel to the Snow Summit Mountain Resort’s popular skiing and snowboarding slopes. A snowplow driver had found the truck blocking the road about 8:30 a.m., about a mile up the narrow path.

From the tire tracks in the ice, it seemed clear the driver had slid backward on his way into the mountains and found himself impossibly stuck. Deputies surmised that he had used propane to set a fire in the cab, and abandoned it in haste.

Inside the truck, deputies found the blackened parts of two AR-15 assault rifles, a charred portion of a Glock handgun, and the remains of a tent, a survival knife and a camping stove. Scattered through the truck, and in the surrounding snow, were hundreds of high-caliber rifle rounds that had exploded in the fire.


Deputies realized it could be a trap. If this was Dorner’s truck, he might be in the trees now, watching them through his sniper scope. They pulled back and brought in SWAT to search the woods. An armored truck extricated the Titan from the ice, and a tow truck carried it to the resort’s parking lot.

The license plate was missing, but detectives found the vehicle-ID number deep inside the truck, on a piece of steel riveted to a plate between the engine block and the cab. It was Dorner’s truck.

What had Dorner been doing up here? Had he hoped to hide on the mountain? Did he know that it was law-enforcement appreciation day at Snow Summit, and cops would be all over the slopes? Had he planned to find a sniper perch and kill some of them?

Within hours, hundreds of law officers had coalesced on the mountain. Helicopters landed, and more SWAT members poured out. Checkpoints and roadblocks sprang up, resorts were closed, and businesses went into lockdown.

“What a scary morning for me... that’s for sure.”

— U.S. Forest Service employee Bill Crews

Dorner had an hours-long head start. He might be anywhere up here, or long gone. He might have hitchhiked off the mountain. Was the torched truck part of a diversion? Or had he burned it in panic?

Helicopters criss-crossed the mountains. Big Bear Lake had thousands of homes, many of them vacant. Searchers in ski masks crept between cabins, guns drawn. They looked in one-room shacks and in sprawling vacation homes, in campgrounds and in Depression-era cabins. They crept up long uphill driveways without cover.

Late that day, as the wind picked up across Big Bear, investigators interviewed a 45-year-old woman named Reyna Eblin, who lived down the hill from where Dorner had abandoned his truck. She said she had spotted him from her driveway that morning.

Shielded from view behind her truck, she had watched him walk down the middle of the road, in Army boots and camouflage pants, carrying something stiff under his jacket.

Bloodhounds bounded into the surrounding woods. They had Dorner’s scent, sucked from a washcloth he had left in a hotel, but could not find his trail.

Darkness fell across the mountains and the cold deepened. The cloud cover and the high trees blocked the moon.

Locals stocked up on food, barricaded their doors and kept their guns and rifles close.



Like the Santa Ana wind that envelops millions of disparate Southern Californians in its grip, a sense of unease pervaded workaday rhythms across a vast region. On TV, on news blogs, on social media, the story of the fugitive L.A. cop gone rogue became a point of frenzied interest.

Reporters stood in the snow with microphones, updating viewers on every turn in the search. Carnage of any scale, at any place, now seemed thinkable.

On the way to work, drivers could see police staking out one freeway on-ramp after another. The thin blue line was usually invisible. Suddenly it was omnipresent and fearsomely armed. It felt like someone else’s country.
 
“  Of course he knows what he’s doing. We trained him.” 
— LAPD Chief Charlie Beck

Police were scared. They strapped on ballistic shields and checked their guns. They sent kids to the homes of trusted friends, erasing visible links to loved ones, yanking vacation photos from Facebook. They walked to their cars in pairs, and drove home watching the rearview mirror.

People who looked like Dorner, even vaguely, were also scared. One of them wrote on his T-shirt: “NOT CHRIS DORNER PLEASE DO NOT SHOOT.”

On CNN, Anderson Cooper announced that his staff had received a package from Dorner a few days earlier. Inside was an LAPD memento coin with a bullet hole in it.

Former LAPD Chief William J. Bratton had given Dorner the coin, to honor his military service, and had later approved his firing. But he told Cooper he didn’t remember Dorner.

“He clearly has a beef with you,” Cooper said.

“A lot of police officers get discharged,” Bratton said.

On billboards and fliers, TV screens and Internet posts, Dorner’s face was everywhere. In every photo, he seemed to wear a huge smile.

“Of course he knows what he’s doing,” LAPD Chief Charlie Beck told the press. “We trained him.”
 

Norwalk
 



To coordinate the manhunt, authorities established a command post at a secretive facility in Norwalk. It was called the Joint Regional Intelligence Center, or JRIC, which occupied a nondescript office building and was meant for large multi-agency operations, including terror attacks.

Now it was a 24/7 nerve center of ringing phones and clicking computers, a bustle of local, state and federal agencies — including more than 40 detectives — dedicated to catching Dorner.

For the U.S. marshals, who were part of the team, Dorner represented an unusual quarry in that he lacked a criminal record, which meant he had no known network of accomplices. Agents watched his mother and sister, in case he reached out. They monitored his cellphone, his bank account and his credit cards. But he had gone off the grid.

Thomas Hession, chief of the marshals’ fugitive task force, was optimistic that Dorner would be captured. The question was how many people would die first. “The fugitive that completely drops off the face of the Earth is one in a million,” Hession said. “People are creatures of habit.”

That is why, he said, so many high-speed chases ended in the suspect’s driveway, and why he once caught a killer who couldn’t give up a favorite dry-cleaner. Dorner would probably stick to one of the places he knew, like Nevada, California or Utah. And sooner or later, wherever he was, he would make a mistake.

At the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, which was leading the search of the mountain, detectives wondered: Was Dorner nearly as good a tactician as he portrayed himself to be? Had the military given him specialized guerrilla or cold-weather training?
 
 Again and again, detectives saw the gap between Dorner’s boasts and his achievements.

The Navy said he had gone through basic combat training, and was an expert marksman, but otherwise had not been drilled in special tactics. He had guarded an oil rig at sea, but had not been in battle. He had flunked out of flight school. He had failed to get promoted and skipped the required drills. Somehow, he had managed to get out with an honorable discharge.

Again and again, detectives saw the gap between Dorner’s boasts and his achievements. In his attempt to impress women, he had falsely claimed to be an Internal Affairs investigator, a narcotics officer or a SWAT team member. He had displayed grisly war photos, passing himself off as a combat vet.

His LAPD record showed that he had struggled through the academy — it took him 13 months to graduate, rather than the customary six. He had punched one recruit and tried to choke another. He had fired a bullet into his own hand. Even in his 30s, he admitted to friends, he relied heavily on his mother for financial support. In his flight from the law, he had been unable to steal a boat from an 81-year-old man.


Riverside
 



On Friday, cabdriver Karam Kaoud drove to Riverside Community Hospital and parked.

He walked up and found a security guard. He wasn’t family, he explained, but he wanted to know if he could see the young Riverside police officer who had been shot by Dorner the day before.

He didn’t say that he had witnessed the shooting, and that he had used the police radio to help save Officer Andrew Tachias’ life.

The guard left and came back and said no. Tachias was under guard.

Back in his cab, Kaoud called Riverside police. Would they let him see the officer?

The dispatcher who answered the phone asked if he was related.

“No,” he said. “I just wanted to know if he is OK. This is important to me.”

“He’s getting better.”
 

Big Bear Lake
 



Det. Alex Collins had joined the search on the mountain. He was in his detective’s suit and tie, freezing. He and his partner set up motion-sensing cameras, bolting them to trees and telephone poles.

Collins and other detectives searched cabins for surveillance cameras, hoping that one of them had captured Dorner. They studied video footage from gas stations, hoping that Dorner had been seen pumping gas. They searched the trunks and back seats of cars coming and going on the mountain. Nothing.

As night fell Friday, searchers trudged back to the command post after 14-hour shifts in a state of taut-nerved alertness. Their exhaustion was exacerbated by the knee-high snow, 60-pound vests and the thin, high air. Now, with snow piled up to the doors of their trucks, they passed around shovels.
 

Los Angeles
 



As the manhunt wore on, the LAPD’s threat-assessment team — including detectives, commanders and the department’s top shrink — met twice a day in the big, wood-paneled conference room on the 10th floor of headquarters.

On the white board, the names of potential targets had grown to 77. Protection details were working 12- to 14-hour shifts.

Traps were set outside the houses of some top-level targets. A single black-and-white would be stationed outside, to give Dorner the impression of light protection. Positioned in the surrounding neighborhoods were 16-man undercover teams.

This required officers with specialized training, however, and their ranks were fast depleted.

Some people on the target list felt stifled by their guards, and wanted to be left alone. Most stayed in town, a fact that didn’t surprise the department’s head psychologist, Kevin Jablonski. “They are armed,” he said. “Their personalities say, ‘Don’t run.’ ”
 
“  He’s delusional. But don’t make him a Looney Tune.” 
—LAPD psychologist Kevin Jablonski


Share this quote

The psychologist thought Dorner was hunkered down in a cabin in Big Bear, “not hidden in the snowbank like James Bond.” He tried to make sense of Dorner’s actions. The attempt to get to Mexican waters. The drive into the mountains. The abandoned truck. Were they part of a master plan? Or were they the actions of someone in way over his head and prone to panic?

Jablonski studied Dorner’s language and saw a man who expected to die. He advised the San Bernardino County SWAT team to assume that he was booby-trapped, should he appear to be surrendering. They should approach him as if he would fight to the last breath.

He had some advice for his own department. Don’t use the terms “mentally ill” or “psychopath” in public about Dorner, he explained. It might further inflame him.

“This guy doesn’t want to be blamed for anything that’s going on,” Jablonski said. “He’s delusional. But don’t make him a Looney Tune.”

Chief Charlie Beck and his spokesman heeded the advice, but it did not stop others from pronouncing publicly on Dorner’s mental health. “He’s entitled, he’s narcissistic,” said one former police psychologist. Another added that he suffered from a “psychiatric illness.”

Jablonski had more advice for his chief: Announce that the case leading to Dorner’s firing would be reopened. This might give Dorner some pause, maybe enough to catch him.



In one sense, Dorner’s killings had already achieved their desired effect. People were reading his splenetic screed, and more than a few had already bought into his self-portrayal as a righteous man wronged.

On Facebook, pages had sprung up praising Dorner as a folk hero who had dared to defy the law enforcement establishment. Police were portrayed as gangsters in uniform who had again shown their disregard for civilian life in the two Torrance shootings.
 
To the people hunting him, Dorner’s lionization was an outrage.

“Christopher Dorner For President,” one page was entitled. Another admirer called him “Chocolate Rambo.” On social media, people vented about bad experiences with police, unjust workplaces, lost jobs, lying bosses, discrimination.

To many familiar with the history and culture of the LAPD, some of his accusations seemed plausible, at least on their face. He claimed the agency had railroaded him for reporting a supervisor’s misbehavior. Others had complained about such retaliation for years, citing a Blue Wall of Silence that forbade cops to snitch on other cops.

He portrayed the agency as a caldron of racism, and this resonated among those who remembered the Rodney King beating, the aggressive round-ups of black men during the gang wars of the 1980s, and LAPD Det. Mark Fuhrman, whose incendiary racist rants surfaced at the O.J. Simpson murder trial.



To the people hunting him, Dorner’s lionization was an outrage. For his first victim, they pointed out, the supposed crusader for racial justice had selected a defenseless young black man and shot him in the back of the head.

Riverside Police Chief Sergio Diaz, who had stood over Crain’s body at the hospital, called support for Dorner “ignorance and hate masquerading as intellectualism.”

There was nothing ambiguous about it, Diaz said. He was a murderer, plain and simple. “For this knucklehead, this cockroach to become an icon....”

Some of the lawmen hunting Dorner studied his manifesto for clues about what he might do next.

Justin Musella of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s SWAT team concluded that Dorner would probably stay hidden until the heat died down. “We have to handle him totally separately from anything we’ve ever dealt with,” he said.

His SWAT colleague, Chad Johnson, read a few pages and tossed it aside. Its author had hunted down and murdered a man’s daughter.

“That’s all you need to know,” he said.
 

Big Bear Lake
 



On Saturday morning, Det. Alex Collins and his partner methodically checked the cameras they had spread around the mountain. No hits.

The sky over the mountain was a marvelous blue. Tourists were coming back, lured by the promise of 18 inches of fresh snow. They reasoned that Dorner must be gone.

Helicopters continued to criss-cross the mountains with cameras so sensitive they could detect a rabbit from the air. No sign.

Collins and other detectives visited utility companies, trying to determine if any of the cabins had seen a sudden spike in water, gas or electricity.

An address in Big Bear Lake jumped out, and soon Collins was in a helicopter looking at footprints in the snow around the cabin.

SWAT went in by Snowcat. No Dorner.
 

San Gabriel Valley
 



Charlie Beck was waiting for the shooting to start again.

An elite team of officers was guarding his home, set on two acres of winding horse trails at the end of a San Gabriel Valley cul-de-sac. At night it grew bitterly cold. He put space heaters in the garage for them; his wife brought cookies.

Beck’s three grown children were staying at the house, two of them cops themselves. “I need you guys to take care of each other,” he told them. “Think of yourself as a line of defense.”

Beck saw the adulation for Dorner as partly a reflection of Americans’ deep-rooted affection for anti-heroes. A lone rebel versus the LAPD’s Evil Empire — people who cheered Dorner seemed to want the story to fit that convenient template.

The real story was something else, thought Beck. It was about a failed cop, angry and paranoid and perhaps mentally ill, who blamed everyone but himself for his shortcomings.

On Saturday, the fourth day of the manhunt, Beck announced that he would reopen Dorner’s termination case. It was “not to appease a murderer,” he said, but to assure people that the LAPD was “fair and transparent.”

“I am aware of the ghosts of the LAPD’s past,” Beck said, “and one of my biggest concerns is that they will be resurrected by Dorner’s allegations of racism within the department.”
 

Los Angeles
 



The announcement stunned Sgt. Teresa Evans, who had been in hiding with her teenage son for four days. The whole case stemmed from Dorner’s accusation — determined by the LAPD to be a lie — that she had kicked a suspect.

She felt betrayed. Would she have to relive what she called the “nightmare”? For most of a year, she had been forced to work behind a desk, barred from earning overtime as she tried to clear her name.

“Are they saying they don’t believe me now?” she asked her lawyer over the phone.

Her lawyer said the chief was playing to public perceptions.

Evans wondered how long it could possibly continue. The first day she had felt too vulnerable at home. Reporters were assembling outside. It meant Dorner could find her too. On the second day, SWAT extracted her and her son, rushing them — both hidden under hooded jackets — into an unmarked van.

Now, with cops stationed in the hall outside, she and her son had adjoining rooms in a hotel with a view from a high floor. She had packed his Xbox, a MacBook, an iPad and some underwear.

Hour after hour, Evans played video soccer with her son. She let him watch a little TV, so he understood the outlines of the situation, but tried to shield him from the details.

SWAT brought her lattes and turkey sandwiches. She picked at the meat. She threw up when she tried to eat. She was 115 pounds and shedding weight by the day.

She did not think Dorner could still be on the mountain. Someone must be helping him elude the dragnet, she thought. What if he was never caught?

Hundreds of tips poured in, most of them useless. 

She would have to quit the police work she loved. She would have to leave the country with her son. She would have to find a new home, maybe in Ireland, with relatives.

She told no one where she was, not even her ex-husband. She refused to stray outside the hotel room into the hall. Someone might notice her and snap a photograph and post it online. As quickly as that, the location of the safe house would be exposed.

She traded texts with her lawyer and friend, Robert Rico, who was also under heavy guard. Considering Dorner’s record, Rico thought, the real question wasn’t why the LAPD had fired him but why he hadn’t been fired sooner.

Evans and Rico kept returning to a disturbing realization: Sooner or later, their protection details would be pulled. “At some point,” Evans would say, “they’re going to dump me out the door and say, ‘Good luck to you.’ ”



Hundreds of tips poured in, most of them useless. One night, police stationed snipers at windows around an apartment building in a rundown San Bernardino neighborhood after a 911 caller claimed Dorner was inside with a stash of guns. It was a fake call, but some wary police still wondered: Was Dorner staging a diversion? Was he watching?

On Sunday, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa stood with Beck and Diaz, the Riverside police chief, to announce a $1-million reward for Dorner’s capture.

“We will not tolerate this reign of terror,” the mayor said.

By the next day, nearly a thousand bad tips had poured in. There were false Dorner sightings from Denver to Chicago.

They found nothing Sunday. They found nothing Monday.

Then it was Tuesday, and as the manhunt entered its seventh day, the Riverside Police Department was nervously preparing to bury Officer Michael Crain.

Dorner was not their only worry. He might have an acolyte, with a gun and a plan.

The memorial service at Grove Community Church, and the burial at nearby Riverside National Cemetery, were expected to draw 8,000 to 10,000 people, many of them cops.

It had been five days since anyone had seen Dorner. “You got a guy who has all kinds of high-powered weapons and a desire to kill,” recalled Riverside Police Department Deputy Chief Jeffrey Greer, who was organizing the service. “I am sweating bullets.”

If Dorner planted himself in the low-lying mountain range overlooking the church, he would have a direct line of sight in a sniper scope. Police tried to calculate if rounds from a .50-caliber rifle might reach mourners from that distance. They sent helicopters into the hills, looking for heat signatures.

They staked out high positions on buildings along the seven-mile stretch the caravan would travel from the church to the cemetery. There were 200 cops lined up to work security, and agencies from everywhere were volunteering manpower.

Dorner was not their only worry. He might have an acolyte, with a gun and a plan.
 

Big Bear Lake
 



On the mountain, search teams were being pulled out.

Dorner might be dead somewhere under the snow, and wouldn’t be found until the snow melted in weeks or months. But if he was still up there, the large crowds attending the upcoming Presidents’ Day weekend — combined with the lighter police presence — would give him a chance to slip away.

Just down the road from the spot where Dorner had abandoned his truck, Jim and Karen Reynolds were cleaning the 13-unit resort they managed in their retirement.

Around noon, they approached Room 203. Jim inserted the key.

Chapter Five: The Mountain

Flushed from hiding, a fugitive makes his stand

By Christopher Goffard, Louis Sahagun, Kurt Streeter and Phil Willon

Illustrations by Doug Stevens

December 15, 2013


Amid gunfire, a SWAT team mounts a rescue attempt for downed deputies. Christopher Dorner’s twisted quest ends in flames. 

 

San Bernardino
 



Everyone hunting him understood the equation. If Christopher Dorner was still alive, he would get the first shot.

Jeremiah MacKay was 35, a large, boisterous, red-haired detective on the major crimes squad of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. He had a wife, an infant son and a 6-year-old stepdaughter. It was hard to find a room in which he was not the loudest man.

MacKay had been searching Big Bear for days. He had grown up nearby, and knew the mountains well.

A fireman’s son with Irish roots, he liked pints of Guinness, expensive Scotch and wearing a kilt on St. Patrick’s Day. He played the bagpipes in the honor guard at police funerals. In his nearly 15 years on the job, he had seen more cop widows and cop orphans and grieving cop parents than almost anyone.

Out of uniform, he preferred not to mention his job, so people would be themselves. He introduced himself as a salesman for a fictional pickle company, with a dirty pun in the title. “They sell them at Trader Joe’s,” he would say. “A gourmet brand.”

As he hunted for Dorner that week, he received a call from a buddy on the force.

“Whoever finds him is gonna get killed, because he gets to act first,” the friend said. “Whoever opens that door...”

“I’m gonna get him,” MacKay said. “He’s a cop killer.”
 

Big Bear Lake
 



Jim and Karen Reynolds were about to find Christopher Dorner.

The couple, married 36 years, lived above the office of the Mountain Vista Resort on Club View Drive, which they ran with their grown daughter.

Jim was 66, a former Navy man and IBM system engineer, tall, lanky, and white-haired, with wild, bushy eyebrows. Karen was 56, a former nurse, small, sweet-faced and bespectacled.

Their resort was a cluster of 1980s-era brown condo units, with maple trees and a towering Ponderosa pine. They were going room to room, stripping sheets and collecting towels, when they came to Room 203.

Five days before, when Dorner’s pickup was discovered up the road, Jim had methodically checked the doors and found this cabin locked. It had been unlocked earlier for repairs, he knew, but he assumed one of his family members had re-locked it.

Now, Jim opened the door and they entered, climbing the red-carpeted stairway. It led upstairs to a living room with an old stone fireplace, a kitchenette and a sliding-glass door that opened onto a snow-covered balcony.

Jim went to the window to examine the curtain rod, which needed repairs. Karen was heading toward the hallway that led to a bedroom, looking for fresh linens.

Dorner emerged from the hallway, pointing a handgun.

Karen recognized him at once. She yelled and ran back down the stairs toward the entrance. She had the door open. She was partway through. She hesitated.

She couldn’t leave her husband. She couldn’t risk leading Dorner to her daughter, who was somewhere on the property. She thought of her own life: If you go out that door, he has to shoot you.

In a moment Dorner was on her, digging his fingers into her forearm.

Upstairs, Jim fumbled for the smartphone in the rubber case on his waist, but couldn’t get it free in time to dial 911. He hid it in the sofa cushions.

Dorner came back up the stairs with Karen and said, “I know you know who I am.”
 
 For the first time, Karen understood the literal truth of the concept of being paralyzed with fear.

Jim thought they were as good as dead. It was an hour’s drive, at least, to get off the mountain. His only chance of escape was to kill them.

By appearances, Dorner had been there for days. There were trail mix wrappers and containers for ready-to-eat meals. There were footprints on the snow-covered balcony. He had used a towel in the downstairs shower.

Jim thought Dorner looked well-rested, with a couple days’ growth of beard, and composed like a man trained to handle tense situations.

After abandoning his truck, Dorner would have had to walk only a short distance to reach Club View Drive. From there, at a brisk pace, past log cabins and gracious A-frames and porches adorned with antlers and carved wooden bears, he would have made it to their resort in five minutes.

The San Bernardino County sheriff would insist that searchers had checked it, but had found no signs of forced entry, and were not authorized to kick down the door. The Reynoldses said deputies never contacted them to ask permission to go inside.

However it happened, Dorner’s presence had been missed. From the room’s porch window, he could have seen his truck towed into the parking lot of the ski resort across the street.

He could have seen police helicopters landing and taking off, and an army of law enforcement – police, sheriff’s deputies and federal agents – coming and going from the command post. Along with fleets of reporters and cameramen, they would have passed easily within range of his sniper scope.

Because the room had an Internet hookup and cable, he could have watched the manhunt unfold live, and learned that the massive effort was dwindling.

“I just want to clear my name,” Dorner told the Reynoldses.

The couple was shaking with fear. Dorner explained that he had spared the San Diego yacht owner, and would spare them too. They were merely means to an end.

Jim thought of mentioning that he had been a Navy man himself. Maybe this would endear him to Dorner, and increase the odds of survival. Then he remembered hearing that Dorner’s stint with the Navy had ended badly.

Jim thought fleetingly of throwing himself on Dorner, maybe distracting him just long enough for his wife to escape. But he doubted she would leave him anyway. And trying to overpower a bigger, younger, stronger man seemed a fool’s errand.

“Do you have a car?” Dorner demanded.

Yes, they said, it was parked in front of the office with a full tank of gas. A purple-maroon Nissan Rogue. He took the key.

Dorner ordered them to kneel on the sofa with their faces against the wall, their ankles crossed and their hands up.

Dorner said he had seen Jim shoveling snow a few days earlier.

“You are good, hard-working people,” he said.

They felt Dorner tightening zip-ties around their wrists. Dorner took Karen’s cellphone out of her jacket pocket. He ordered them to their feet, and told them to go down the hallway toward the bedroom.


Watch: Big Bear couple held captive 

 


“Calm down, I’m not going to kill you, let’s go back upstairs.”

— Karen Reynolds, recounting what Christopher Dorner said to her

Get Flash Player

“Don’t look around,” he said. “Look at the ceiling.”

In the bedroom, atop a small dresser, Jim noticed pieces of carrots and a dull-bladed butcher knife from the kitchen. He is going to hack us to death back here, he thought.

Dorner ordered them to lie face-down on the floor, then tightened zip-ties around their feet. Searching Jim’s pockets, Dorner found a Hershey bar and asked if he was a diabetic.

“Yes,” he said.

“Oh s---,” Dorner said.

He put the chocolate between them on the carpet.

He left the room and returned with washcloths to stuff in their mouths. He pulled pillowcases over their heads. He found electrical cords and tied them around their heads, to hold the gags in place. He jerked their heads back.

“Say the alphabet,” Dorner ordered her.

“A...B...C...D...E...F...G...H...I...J...K...” She slurred and mumbled more than necessary, to convey the impression the gag could be no tighter, and Dorner seemed satisfied when she reached “K.”

He pushed them face-down on the carpet. They could hear him packing a bag. He asked calmly if they would be quiet long enough for him to escape.

For the first time, Karen understood the literal truth of the concept of being paralyzed with fear. But she managed to nod.
 

They heard his footsteps in the hallway. They listened for the thump of the front door closing. Instead, they heard Dorner’s voice, now tinged with panic: “These aren’t car keys!”

It was a keyless car, they explained through their gags. Just push the starter.

Dorner disappeared again.

Karen was terrified that he would run into her daughter, who was on the property, maybe in the laundry room just below. She felt her hands and feet swelling from the zip-ties. She maneuvered her head down to Jim’s hands. His fingers fumbled uselessly as he tried to get the pillowcase off her face.

She scooted and wriggled until her hands were at Jim’s head, and her fingers found purchase and removed his pillowcase. Then he was able to pull off hers.

She rocked back and forth, struggling to her knees and then her feet. She saw the butcher knife on the dresser and got its handle in her teeth. Maybe the edge would cut the zip-ties.

She dialed 911. She got an operator. Dorner is in Big Bear, she said.

She dropped the knife toward Jim, hoping he could grab it. She heard a noise through the door. She kicked the knife against the wall, where it would be hidden behind the door if Dorner returned.

They waited. Dorner did not return. She pushed down on the door handle and hopped into the hallway and into the living room. With her hands still tied behind her back, she grabbed the land-line and tried to dial 911 but couldn’t manage it.

She noticed that Dorner had inexplicably left her smartphone on the coffee table. It was a new phone, and it took awhile to find the speaker-phone button.

She dialed 911. She got an operator. Dorner is in Big Bear, she said. He has our car. It was 12:23 p.m. He had a head start of 15 to 30 minutes.



Det. Alex Collins had spent the morning searching the woods near the condo, trying to rethink his assumptions about where the fugitive might be. He and his partner were back at the Big Bear station, about to head to lunch, when the radios crackled: Dorner was near Big Bear. He was driving a stolen purple Nissan Rogue.

Collins and his partner grabbed their tactical vests and rifles and jumped into the truck. On his iPhone, Collins Googled “Nissan Rogue” so he could be sure what it looked like.

There were only a few ways off the mountain, and they reasoned that Dorner would not risk California Highway 18, which would take him through town.

They guessed he would try to sneak out the back way, on California Highway 38, toward Redlands.
 

Yucaipa, Calif.
 



Deputy Jeremiah MacKay was at his office at the Yucaipa station when he got the word. That morning, detectives had visited his office to seek his help on a drug-related homicide, but the talk had quickly turned to Dorner.

The men knew the mountain, and batted around ideas about where he could be. It seemed outrageous that one man could hold law enforcement hostage like this.

MacKay said what he had been saying all week: “I want to get him.”

He raced up the mountain.
 

San Bernardino National Forest
 



On Highway 38, near Glass Road, four law enforcement officers — two San Bernardino County deputies and two state Fish and Wildlife wardens — were setting up a checkpoint and laying spike strips.

They noticed a pair of school buses coming down the narrow, winding highway, headed west. The Nissan Rogue was following close behind, as if to guard against the spike strips. Dorner was at the wheel.

The officers jumped into their cars and gave chase. Dorner swerved around the buses and accelerated. In the time it took the pursuing cars to get around the buses, Dorner had vanished.

They guessed that he had hooked a hard right on Glass Road, which twisted downhill through thick, snow-covered forest toward the community of Seven Oaks.

They raced down, rifles out the window. About a mile down the road, they found the Rogue smashed against a snowbank, the windshield cracked, the air bags deployed. Inside, Dorner had abandoned a package of Quickclot, meant to pour on wounds, and a small arsenal: smoke grenades, tear-gas canisters and a silencer-equipped Remington sniper rifle bearing the word VENGEANCE.

Nearby, on the same road, a 62-year-old man who ran a local Boy Scout camp was driving by in his silver Dodge Ram when Dorner walked out of the trees aiming his assault rifle. The driver parked and raised his hands.

“I don’t want to hurt you,” Dorner said. “Just get out.”

Three wardens, stationed down the hill at Seven Oaks, were now racing up Glass Road in two separate trucks, lights flashing and sirens blaring.

They were looking for the purple Nissan, not the stolen Dodge pickup in which Dorner was now hurtling toward them.

Dorner crossed paths with the first warden, who noticed Dorner behind the wheel and radioed a warning to the second truck.

Dorner raised his AR-15 and fired at the second truck, a four-door Chevrolet pickup. Inside were two wardens and a German shepherd, Reno. Bullets struck the windshield. The roof. The driver’s window. The door jamb. Glass shattered on the wardens.

They knew a rule from the academy: Drive through an ambush, then get back into the fight.

One of the wardens, Ben Matias, an ex-Marine, jumped out of the truck, ran to a berm and spotted Dorner taking sharp turns down the hill. He took aim with his .308 assault rifle and emptied a 20-round magazine at the fleeing truck. It disappeared.



Det. Alex Collins, racing to the scene, received calls in quick succession from both his older brothers. Like him, they were San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies hunting for Dorner. They told him the same thing: Be careful. Don’t rush in alone. Wait for us.

With his partner driving, Collins was scanning the woods around Glass Road over the top of his Mini-14 semiautomatic rifle, forest rushing by on both sides. They passed the Fish and Wildlife truck with the blown-out driver’s side window.

They hung a left at the bottom of Glass Road. On the right, at 40700 Seven Oaks Road, stood an empty one-story wood cabin. A stone fireplace rose above its east side. It sat amid a towering forest of white oaks, black oaks and cedar pines.

He’d been running scenarios through his head all week, preparing himself. What if he found Dorner on the road? In a car? In a closet?

Trucks of law officers hurtled past the cabin. Collins and his partner stopped just west of it and climbed out.

They were looking for the stolen truck. Where they found it, they knew, they would find Dorner. But there was no sign of it anywhere around the cabin.

They did not know that Dorner had sent it to the bottom of an embankment behind the cabin.

They did not know that he was now inside the cabin, waiting for a target.

Collins was side-stepping along the road, head tilted over his aimed rifle, when he saw a flash. He had the sensation of being punched in the face. A round from Dorner’s assault rifle entered just under his left nostril, crashed through the roof of his mouth, shattered his front teeth, split his tongue and exploded bone as it emerged from his lower right jaw. His face went numb.

The bullets seemed to be coming from a cabin window, but the muffled pop pop pop from Dorner’s silencer made it hard to pinpoint where. Another round struck Collins just below the left kneecap. A round passed through his left forearm. A round struck his chest.

He scrambled behind the back wheel of another cop’s silver Dodge Durango and collapsed. Bullets were flying all around him. Rounds sailed through the truck. Shattered glass from the Dodge fell at his feet.

Dorner seemed to be shooting carefully, whenever he saw an exposed human shape. He was firing at the pavement under the truck, trying to kill with ricochets.

Collins thought: “In seconds, I’ll pass out and die.”

He was choking on his blood and teeth. He was sure the burning in his chest was a high-powered AR-15 round that had pierced his ballistic vest.

He thought: “It wasn’t supposed to happen like this.”

He’d been running scenarios through his head all week, preparing himself. What if he found Dorner on the road? In a car? In a closet? He’d tried to imagine how he would react. And now he was close to death with no idea how it had happened.

Trim and athletic, he ran three miles a day, and he knew how to push through pain. But the pain in his leg was excruciating, and he thought: “If I am going to die, God, let me go now.”

He felt he had let everybody down. He thought of how furious his brothers would be at him.

He had to call his wife. He would spend his last seconds telling her he loved her, and explaining that he wouldn’t be home tonight, that he was sorry he let this happen, sorry for leaving her alone with a brand-new baby.

He reached under his ballistic vest. He kept his iPhone in a jacket pocket over his heart. The phone was shattered. Angrily, he hurled it away.

Seconds passed, and he realized he wasn’t dead yet. He heard yelling and gunfire.

He thought: “Don’t panic. Don’t freak out.”

Collins watched his own blood pooling on the pavement. Then something happened that he did not understand.

He thought of his training at the Sheriff’s Academy, where cops who had been shot spoke of the Will to Live, of never giving up. He thought of the Navy SEAL in one of his favorite books, “Lone Survivor,” who had survived horrific injury in Afghanistan.

He leaned forward on his arm, to allow the blood filling up his throat to pour onto the pavement.

A few feet away, Deputy Jeremiah MacKay had scrambled behind another wheel of the Dodge and was firing at the cabin. A rescue chopper was overhead, and MacKay got on the radio to tell the pilot which structure Dorner was firing from.

“It’s gonna be right from where you’re at now,” MacKay said, his words captured on a dispatch recording. “Right ahead of you — right ahead of you — directly underneath you right now —”

Seconds later, as he tried to direct the helicopter, MacKay lost just enough of his cover to give Dorner a target.

The bullet went in at a high angle, right above MacKay’s ballistic shield, and ricocheted into his chest. He was dead almost instantly.

A few feet away, Collins watched his own blood pooling on the pavement. Then something happened that he did not understand. He turned his head and saw that he was completely exposed to the cabin. The Dodge Durango that had been shielding him had vanished. He saw his rifle in the road, but couldn’t reach it. He waited for a bullet to hit his head.

A hasty rescue attempt had cost him his cover. One cop had intended to drag the shot deputies out of the line of fire, using the Dodge — driven by a second cop — as a moving shield. Amid the fear and pandemonium and flying bullets, the truck was driven off, and the downed deputies left in the road.


They called it the kill zone, a wide-open stretch of road in the direct line of Dorner’s assault rifle, and now Collins and MacKay lay in the middle of it. For perhaps 20 or 30 yards, there were no cars, no trees, no sources of cover at all.

“Shots fired. Officer down....”

“Automatic fire coming in-bound....”

“Officers still down in the kill zone....”

San Bernardino County Sheriff’s SWAT Sgt. John Charbonneau raced up in his truck. In the seat beside him was Det. Justin Musella, who had fought as an Army Ranger in Afghanistan, and who now recognized the faint THWUP THWUP THWUP of silenced high-powered rounds flying from the cabin.

“Sergeant, stop! We’re getting shot at!”

They jumped out and opened fire at the cabin. More cops arrived, and raced to find cover behind trucks and trees. Glass fragments flew outward from the cabin as Dorner fired. There was the rustle of a curtain in one of the cabin’s east windows.

Officers poured in rounds. Dorner’s bullets zipped overhead. They thwacked into trees and pierced the sides of cars. The smell of gunpowder saturated the thin, cold air.

The two downed deputies still lay motionless in the road, and for the men who could see them every second was excruciating. Instinct told them to race out and retrieve their brothers; logic told them this would guarantee their own quick death.

They needed an armored vehicle to provide cover for the rescue, but nobody could say how long it would take to get it there.

Musella sprinted closer toward the cabin, taking cover behind a small, wooden, free-standing game room across the driveway. He tossed a smoke grenade toward Dorner, but it landed in the snow. The smoke churned upward; the wind blew it back toward the officers.

He threw another. This time, the smoke rose and created a wall between the cabin and the downed deputies.

On the west side, SWAT deputies Daniel Rosa and Larry Lopez locked eyes. This was their chance.

Lopez ran into the road first, as officers laid down a barrage of cover fire. He grabbed the first deputy he came to, MacKay, a big man, and dragged him 25 to 50 yards until they were behind a shield of trucks. Breathing hard, he grabbed his rifle and looked at Rosa.

“Your turn,” he said.

Rosa sprinted out to Collins. He grabbed his vest and started dragging.



Tell my brothers I love them, Collins was saying. Tell them I’m sorry I screwed up.

He felt himself being loaded into the back of someone’s pickup truck, and then a blaze of pain as MacKay’s body was loaded on board partly on top of his wounded leg. He saw himself bleeding into a pair of spare boots. He thought: Someone will be mad.

The high-powered round had pierced his ballistic shield and been deflected by the iPhone in his jacket pocket.

He was aware of a gurney beneath him, of men carrying him into a rescue chopper.

Put me on my stomach, he managed to say, or I will choke on my blood.

On the way to Loma Linda Hospital, he clutched his cloth sheriff’s badge in his fist. He did not know why. He was still conscious when the emergency room staff cut off his clothes and boots.

Doctors examined his chest. The high-powered round had pierced his ballistic shield and been deflected by the iPhone in his jacket pocket. It had saved his life.



Around the cabin, after perhaps 10 minutes of furious gunfire, everything slowed down. There were 30 or 40 officers with assault rifles forming a perimeter to ensure that Dorner wouldn’t escape. They passed around fresh ammunition magazines.

A dozen cops were trapped, hunkered behind a row of trucks in front of the cabin. When an armored personnel carrier finally reached them, 45 minutes after the shooting had started, they scrambled inside and got away.

Deputies received word, from the cabin owner, that the property was not occupied, dispelling worries that Dorner might have a hostage. They learned the cabin had a basement.

Was the LAPD so zealous because Dorner had been one of their own? Did they doubt their San Bernardino counterparts could handle the crisis?

A team of LAPD SWAT officers had taken command of a fire helicopter and flown to the mountain. They were deposited on a ridge about a half-mile north of the cabin.

“I’m not sure if they were invited or not, or if anyone’s controlling them,” a sheriff’s deputy said over the radio.

Not only had the helicopter presented another target for Dorner’s rifle, but the local deputies lacked direct radio contact with the LAPD team, which created the possibility of confusion and chaos.

Was the LAPD so zealous because Dorner had been one of their own? Did they doubt their San Bernardino counterparts could handle the crisis? A “miscommunication,” the LAPD called it, a result of bad cellphone and radio coverage in the mountains.

Whatever the reason, San Bernardino County sheriff’s commanders were furious. They ordered the LAPD team not to get any closer.



From the SWAT truck, an amplified voice boomed an order to surrender: You are surrounded. You have no chance of escape.

No response.

They fired canisters of tear gas into the cabin. Still no sign of Dorner.

At 3:45 p.m. a sheriff’s deputy rumbled toward the cabin in an armored tractor and tore into the east wall with an extendable claw. The claw ripped out a door and some windows. A camera mounted on the tractor appeared to show a wall covered in blood.

Police later surmised this was not blood but the orange-red burst of pepper spray from a gas canister.

At 4:05 p.m., greenish smoke emerged from the cabin. Dorner had popped his own smoke canister, apparently expecting that the SWAT team would be rushing into the house. The smoke would blind them, and give him an advantage.

This meant Dorner was alive. Nobody rushed in.

SWAT command decided to shoot in canisters of CS gas, called burners. Also known as hot gas, or pyrotechnic tear gas, it had a propensity to spark fires.
 
 At 4:20 p.m., from the cabin, there came the sound of a single gunshot. 

Share this excerpt

Critics would question this decision. Why not just wait Dorner out?

Dorner had shown no willingness to surrender. He had not attempted to communicate with deputies. He was well-armed, and possibly equipped with rations, meaning the standoff could go on indefinitely. His manifesto made it clear he planned to die.

The shadows of the tall pines were lengthening. Every minute represented further risk to the law officers, risk that would multiply when darkness overtook the snowbound mountains. Dorner might possess night-vision goggles that would enable him to find targets.

On their radios, deputies orchestrated the end-game.

“We’re going to go forward with the plan, with the burner....”

Hot gas went in at 4:09 p.m. Flames began to spread. They waited for Dorner; he did not emerge.

“Seven burners deployed, and we have a fire.”

“We have a fire in the front and he might come out the back....”

At 4:20 p.m., from the cabin, there came the sound of a single gunshot.

“No. 4 side fully engulfed....”

A firetruck was told to hang back a couple hundred yards. Ignited by fire, ammunition was exploding inside the cabin.

“This thing’s well-constructed.... I still have ammo popping here....”

“Fully engulfed....”

“More ammo going off....”

“I’m told that there’s basement in that cabin.... I’m going to let that heat burn through that basement.”

“Good call....”

The fire wasn’t spreading to nearby homes or trees. They let it burn.



Live on television, people watched the climax of the Dorner manhunt play out in flames.

At Dorner’s favorite watering hole in Las Vegas, bartenders and customers watched.

At the manhunt command post in Norwalk, an army of cops watched.

At LAPD headquarters, the chief stood with the mayor and watched.
 
 “We got him,” one of them said. “It’s OK. We got him.” 

Share this excerpt

At a secret hotel room, Dorner’s former training officer, Teresa Evans, watched.

At Grove Community Church in Riverside, where a viewing was underway for Michael Crain, people had been trying to shield his widow Regina from the news, because it had not been confirmed that it was Dorner in the cabin.

But Regina kept asking where her husband’s friends on the SWAT team were, and finally someone told her they were on the mountain.

At 8 p.m. they still had not shown up, and she pleaded with the church to keep the viewing open a little longer. A few minutes later the SWAT team entered, their faces smeared with camouflage paint.

They took turns hugging her.

“We got him,” one of them said. “It’s OK. We got him.”



Michael Crain’s 10-year-old son walked slowly behind his father’s flag-draped casket the next day. He looked tiny among the police pallbearers, his palms pressed against one end of the casket.

A woman from the neighborhood watched the long caravan of police cars pass by, lights flashing. She told her twin granddaughters: “Put your hands over your hearts.”

Regina Crain received the folded American flag from the police chief, and watched as her husband was buried.

Later, she would ask commanders for the badge her husband had worn the night of his death, so she could put it in a place of honor. They were reluctant, and she knew why: a bullet from Dorner’s AR-15 had torn through her husband’s badge, and the shield, on the way to his heart.



Teresa Evans still did not feel safe.

Maybe the dead man in the cabin was a Dorner look-alike, an accomplice. It did not seem crazier than what had already happened.

“What seemed impossible before is no longer impossible,” she said. “My reality is, I’m not really sure what could happen at any time.”

Back home alone, she coped with her nerves by cleaning. She took down the sheets over the windows. She put the furniture back in place. She couldn’t eat.

Even after experts confirmed that the charred body in the basement was Dorner — first by dental records, then by comparing a sample of Dorner’s DNA kept by the Navy to marrow from the femur of the charred corpse — she remained apprehensive. What if someone tried to finish what he started?

“  What seemed impossible before is no longer impossible.” 
— LAPD Sgt. Teresa Evans

One day, she found that someone had removed her window screen and tried to get inside her house.

Another day, she saw graffiti on a wall near the police station: TERRI EVANS IS A LIAR. On the Web, some people hailed Dorner as a hero and said she deserved whatever she got.

She thought about changing her name, but it would be easy to find the new one in public records. She knew her name would be visible, on her uniform, as long as she wore one.

Not long ago, she drove up the mountain and stared at the blackened hole in the ground where Dorner had died. She badly wanted to talk to the families he had hurt. But she dreaded what they might think. What if they held her responsible for pushing him over the edge?

“I don’t know how people feel about me,” she said. “I don’t know who blames me, and who doesn’t.”

So far, she hasn’t returned to work. Even at the LAPD, she can’t be sure who is her friend.



By his charred corpse, police found the 9-millimeter Glock that Dorner had used to put a single bullet through his temple.

Ballistics analysis matched the gun to the shootings of Keith Lawrence and Monica Quan. The charred AR-15 assault rifle found in the basement was matched to the slayings of Michael Crain and Jeremiah MacKay, and the shootings of Alex Collins and Andrew Tachias.

In Dorner’s wallet, along with a fake police badge, an LAPD business card had survived the cabin fire. On it, he had written the names of two of the police captains who oversaw his Board of Rights. Their addresses were included, and the names of their wives.



For the LAPD’s mistaken shooting of Emma Hernandez and her daughter, Margie Carranza, the newspaper delivery women received a $4-million settlement from the city.

Of the two, Carranza is the more traumatized. She is afraid of police, and afraid to go out at night. When she takes her children to the movies, she sits separately from them.

Her logic is simple. If someone comes with a gun to kill her, she does not want her children to die too.



Alex Collins spent two months in the hospital, an armed deputy standing guard day and night. A conference room was outfitted with a recliner and a baby crib, so Collins’ wife and infant son could stay close.

His wife wondered what would have happened if he had worn his smartphone in his back pocket that day, instead of over his chest. One day, in his hospital room, he and his wife caught a glimpse of the television news. A man was getting Christopher Dorner’s face tattooed on his arm.

Collins underwent 20 surgeries. The roof of his mouth was repaired, his tongue sewn together, his obliterated teeth replaced, his shattered leg embedded with pins. Plastic surgeons erased the mark of the bullet hole under his nose. He learned to stand with a walker, and finally to do without the walker, and now his limp is barely visible.

He returned to police work in September, in the intelligence division. His son will turn 1 in January.



Riverside Police Officer Andrew Tachias lives in constant pain from Dorner’s bullets. He has no movement in his left arm, and little in his right. He has grown reclusive, and has trouble talking about the shooting that took his partner’s life. “He hasn’t healed at all,” his father says.

The cabdriver who helped save Tachias’ life insists he did nothing extraordinary.

“If you are at same place and same time, I believe you are gonna do the same,” says Karam Kaoud, then thinks about it some more and says, “Actually, I don’t know.”

He still drives a cab, only now he hates to be stopped at red lights. He doesn’t want to be a target.



“I don’t defend what Dorner did, but like many in the community, I believe what he said,” a man told Charlie Beck.

The LAPD chief was standing before a crowd in South Los Angeles. The speaker’s sentiment was no surprise. For those who remembered similar community meetings from 20 years ago, what seemed remarkable was the softer tone. No one shouted at the chief; no one cursed him.

“We hire from the human race and we hire the best people we can, and sometimes they make mistakes,” Beck said.

Recently, the LAPD completed its review of Christopher Dorner’s firing. The conclusion was the same. He had told a lie about his training officer, and his badge had been properly stripped.



Randal Quan drove to the Irvine Police Department to meet the chief detective who had worked his daughter’s killing.

He was there not to discuss the case, but because he had requested the jewelry his daughter had been wearing when she was killed. He wanted to bury her in it.

Usually, the transfer of such property took time. There was red tape.

Det. Victoria Hurtado wanted to ensure he received it without delay. She walked to the property room. She removed Monica Quan’s engagement ring, necklace, bracelets and watch from the sealed evidence bags.

The jewelry was caked with blood.

She found a brush and paper towels, and went to the sink. She began cleaning.

Ever since he died, 10 years ago today, people have been clamoring to tell Elliott Smith's story for him: writers, poets, fellow musicians, his religiously devoted fans—anyone who felt the subliminal undertow of his songs. The urge is understandable. Smith’s music, with its forensic attention to mood, dredges some of our murkiest emotions to the surface and coaxes unnameable sensations into focus. When an artist has this gift, they stir powerful needs.

Since the moment Smith began making solo recordings, beginning with the whispered, hyper-intimate 1994 collection Roman Candle, he has inspired fervent reactions. His story is dotted with followers, people who instinctively grasped the appeal of his music and felt themselves helplessly conscripted to his cause. They became storytellers for Elliott’s genius and originality, champions for someone allergic to championing himself.

What follows is not an oral history of his life, but of his music; specifically, his solo career. The lines between life and music are tangled, of course, in ways that aren’t neatly prizable, and darker stories eventually creep into the frame at the edges. But the arc traced here begins with the emergence of That Voice: the flowering of his talent, the development of the intimate, inscrutable folk-pop he would mine for the rest of his career. That discovery dovetails with the dissolution of his first band, the loud-rocking Heatmiser. In some ways the development of the former triggered the latter. The story told here begins at this hinge point, as Smith begins exploring the possibilities of his fiercely intimate four-track solo recordings that would pull him away from Heatmiser and, eventually, into the national spotlight.

For those who knew him personally, the task of speaking for Elliott Smith wavers between privilege and burden. Many of the 18 people who spoke to me—bandmates, producers, managers, friends—emerged hesitantly, stepping gingerly over their own profound misgivings, issuing grave caveats. They’d been burned before, they warned me. They swore they’d never speak again. The story of their self-imposed silence, and their individual choices to break it or hold it, runs in powerful counterpoint to Smith’s own story. Some of the singer's closest associates have simply declined to go on record: Having been prodded multiple times, they have understandably snapped shut. Some are speaking now for the first time. The combination of profound ambivalence and fierce conviction in their voices, as they opened themselves up, was chastening.

Heatmiser

In 1984, Elliott Smith—born Steven Paul Smith—moves to Portland from Duncanville, Texas, to live with his father, Gary Smith, and Gary’s wife Marta Greenwald. There, at Lincoln High School, he meets Tony Lash, future drummer of Heatmiser, and forms his first band, Stranger Than Fiction. Upon graduating, he goes off to Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he meets Neil Gust and forms an early version of Heatmiser. (It is around this time that Steven Paul Smith begins going by “Elliott.”) When he returns to Portland after graduation, Gust, Smith, Lash, and bassist Brandt Peterson form the final version of that band. 


TONY LASH [high school friend; drummer, Heatmiser]: In the high school band, I played flute and Elliott played clarinet. He was funny, and we were both kind of nerdy. A friend of mine introduced us because we both liked Rush.

Elliott's songs were ridiculously complicated then. He had so many ideas and he hadn't really developed his arrangement skills, so the songs would start in one place and go through all these sections and then end arbitrarily. But having come from a prog background, it wasn't hard for me to negotiate all the time changes. We recorded our one really ambitious album when I was a senior and he was a junior; we definitely aimed high, even if the results weren't necessarily stellar. 

We kept in touch while he was at Hampshire College; I stayed in Portland and went into record production, getting a job at a studio. Every summer we worked on some kind of a project. Then Elliott came back from college and we started playing together again as Heatmiser.

JJ GONSON [manager, Heatmiser; girlfriend]: The first time I saw Heatmiser was in 1993, at X-Ray in Portland. I had this visceral response, which I've only had with a few bands. I was impressed by every single member. Elliott was clearly an uber-talented songwriter, Neil [Gust] was clearly an almost-as-talented songwriter, and they both had terrific singing voices and were really gifted guitar players. The drummer [Tony Lash] was excellent. There was not a slacker in Heatmiser. 

Neil and Elliott had very different guitar skills that complemented each other beautifully. In fact, when I met them, I would say that Neil was the more accomplished of the two. But Elliott had a natural aptitude that was unique. He could hear music and make it come out of his fingers in a way that most guitar players can't. He never stumbled. It was like there was a channel that went straight from his brain to his fingers, and that was immediately evident watching him play live. You only see that kind of skill level once in a while, so when you see it, you know it. 

TONY LASH: I have a lot of fond memories of that time. Portland still has an extremely vibrant music scene, but there was a bit more of a united, focused community with the bands and the people that came to see music then. La Luna, along with a few other places, was the epicenter of that, the place where the large shows happened. We definitely packed our shows, and people were really into it.

.


JJ GONSON: A phenomenal thing happened in Portland in the early 90s. At La Luna, someone had this idea to charge one dollar at the door to see three local bands every Monday night. The club capacity was maybe 1,000, and they got to keep the bar, but the bands could sell merchandise and they got 100% of the door. So every Monday night the bands were pretty much guaranteed at least $300—which was huge in 1993—and the shows had Heatmiser, Crackerbash, Pond, Hazel, the Dandy Warhols. It was all local. It sold out every Monday, because nobody had a job, really—this was the early 90s and there was no work. The bands would get their cash and, more importantly, they would have the experience of playing in front of 1,000 people who knew their songs. What you ended up with is these bands that perform really well. 

Heatmiser were just a phenomenal, rip-your-head-off-and-shove-it-up-your-ass rock band. I saw them hundreds of times. Elliott was so into it; in every photo I took of them onstage from that time, he's biting his lip. The thing I remember most vividly is that he always had this exact same rocking motion in his body language.

[Both Neil and Elliott] were writing really good songs, but I immediately recognized that Elliott was writing in a way that maybe… appealed to me more personally? When they did that Yellow No. 5 EP, the song "Idler" might have been around when I started to go “whoa, whoa, whoa.” That really quiet, haunting thing. Also, at that point I was already hearing some of Roman Candle. It's just that I wasn't hearing it in the same way. I was hearing it at home.







Roman Candle (1994)

In 1993, Smith moves in with JJ Gonson, at a house on Southeast 29th Avenue and Taylor Street in Portland. In the basement, he begins rehearsing and recording the music that would become his first solo release, Roman Candle.


JJ GONSON: We were all kids, hanging out. There was a lot of Sonic the Hedgehog and sitting around. He and I had a very simpatico sense of humor and found a lot of similar interests in music; we'd just sit around and play together for hours and sing. 

For a long time we were “just good friends,” and I remember seeing him leaning against an ex-girlfriend one time and thinking, "Why is that bothering me? That shouldn't be bothering me.” I'd already worked with the band for awhile, and he wrote songs about feeling like he shouldn't be dating me, wanting to, and knowing that it wasn't the right thing to do. Neither of us would deal with it for a long time. And when we finally did, all of our friends were like, "No! That's a really bad idea!" [laughs] Was it a bad idea? I don't know. He was the love of my life in a lot of ways. I'm enormously grateful to have had that emotional experience. I think that everybody should be that in love with somebody, even if it has to come to an end.

At the Taylor Street house, he would sit upstairs playing for hours and hours and hours, working on the songs, and then he'd go downstairs for half an hour and put something down on tape. He didn't spend very much time in the "studio," which was the basement. It was gross down there; he was perched on a stool surrounded by garbage. It wasn't like it was a couch and cappuccinos. I don't even think we had a washing machine. He was welcome to be down there by himself, nobody wanted to be down there.

The whole sound quality of Roman Candle is entirely based on the fact that he's using a low-quality microphone right up against his fingers. He doesn't even have an acoustic pickup—he's playing an acoustic guitar into a microphone. 

I had a copy of the finished cassette on me all the time and I was listening to it all the time. I had a lot of friends at Sub Pop and Matador and Cavity Search and all these record labels, and I was hanging out with them because I was promoting [Heatmiser], and I needed these labels to put their bands on tour with my band, but I didn’t burst into Cavity Search Records like, "You have to play this! It's the best thing you've ever heard and you need to release it right now." I was probably just like, "I've got this solo cassette by Elliott." "What? Elliott does solo stuff?" I put it on and their jaws dropped. They released it without changing a thing. That's Roman Candle.

TONY LASH: We mixed Roman Candle in my basement—to the extent that you can mix off of a four-track cassette. It was so different from what Heatmiser was doing. I didn't have a sense right then that it was going to become his big thing. A lot more care was taken with recording his second solo record, but even then it seemed more like an extremely viable side project to me, with Heatmiser as the main focus. 

SLIM MOON [founder, Kill Rock Stars]: I didn't know Elliott at all, but we were both playing on this small tour of solo artists going down the West Coast. The first night was in Seattle, and I missed Elliott's set. The second night was at the Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco, and I was blown away by Elliott's set. So I went out to the car to listen to [Roman Candle] rather than staying for the rest of the show.

I was just flabbergasted. It was so incredibly good. And really, really different from anything anybody else was doing. It was soft and gritty at the same time—a really rare combination. The song that blew me away was "Last Call", it's in my top 10 favorite songs to this day. It's the perfect song in terms of lyrics, melody, as a piece of poetry: "You're a crisis/ You're an icicle/ You're a tongueless talker/ You don't care what you say/ You're a jaywalker and you just walk away." Those lines stick with me. 

There's this little trick that he does in that song where he drops the tuning at the end. It almost feels like it's two songs edited together, except he would play it live and reach over and just turn the tuning peg as he played. It's not a studio trick. It impressed me that it was all done on a four-track, too, because the cheaper the production is, the less you can hide your flaws. Like, Lars [Ulrich] of Metallica is one of the worst drummers I've ever heard, but they hide it because they spend millions recording. [laughs]

LARRY CRANE [owner, Jackpot! Recording Studio; producer/engineer; archivist for Smith's family]: I’m really supportive of the local music scene and everything, but I’m not always impressed by the quality of other people’s work. [laughs] But when I heard Roman Candle, I thought, "Wow, that’s pretty good for the guy from Heatmiser." Initially, I thought Heatmiser were another crummy, wild guitar band that the grunge era brought up. But I started realizing, “Oh wait, they have songs.”

MARGARET MITTLEMAN [manager]: Slim Moon fell in love with Elliott, and he told me I had to come down and see him. I don't remember what he played. I'm more of a vibe person, and Elliott's demeanor hit me right away, right in the stomach. He was just sitting in a chair in the corner, but he seemed so special in every way. 

We talked after that show. My intent was just to help him. He wasn’t interested in a publishing contract or a manager. I was working at BMG Publishing, and one of our goals at the time was to sign things really inexpensively and just offer services. Anyway, he liked us, and he liked that we had done work with Beck, who was a recent artist I had signed. We developed a friendship.







Elliott Smith (1995)

Smith records his self-titled record at friend Leslie Uppinghouse’s house, moving on from Cavity Search to Slim Moon’s Kill Rock Stars label. The album is released on July 25, 1995, accompanied by a larger promotional campaign. 


SLIM MOON: We talked about his ideas or hopes for the next step after Roman Candle, and he mentioned that he was interested in being on K Records. I knew [K owner] Calvin [Johnson], so over the next couple of months, I gave him a copy of the record, told him that Elliott was the real deal, and told him to come see him play. I never heard back from Calvin about that. To my knowledge, Elliott never heard from Calvin either. I talked to Elliott a while later and said, "Would it be cool if Kill Rock Stars put out a 7"?"

We never did multi-record deals at Kill Rock Stars back then. We would just do one album, see how it went, and then discuss it again. Before we put out Elliott Smith, I looked at Soundscan, and it showed that half of the sales of Roman Candle had been in Portland, and he was basically unknown everywhere else. I figured that if anyone could be wildly popular in one town, then that could be replicated everywhere, all you have to do is get the word out. But Elliott Smith really didn't sell that well. 

Part of that was context: At Kill Rock Stars, everything that we had put out to that point was either a sort-of-loud, guitar-based, technically-interesting indie rock band like Unwound or godheadSilo or Universal Order of Armageddon, or it was associated with the Riot Grrrl scene, like Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, and Huggy Bear. And Elliott was really different. So when we sent this acoustic solo singer-songwriter record out to press and college radio, they just went, "Oh, I don't get what this is supposed to be.” Reviewers wouldn't review it. It just got ignored. I don’t think they listened to it and passed on it, I think it just sat on their desk. 

And the other thing was this strong anti-singer-songwriter bias in the early 90s—because indie rock was still coming out of the punk tradition, it was anti-a lot of the things the 70s had been known for, including heartfelt singer-songwriters. So anybody with an acoustic guitar singing under their own name was instantly going to be compared to James Taylor, no matter what they sounded like. People just rolled their eyes, straight off. Maybe there were a couple other people, like Bill Callahan as Smog, and Lou Barlow as Sentridoh, who were doing that, but they were performing under band names. So it was bold of Elliott to perform under his own name. 

JJ GONSON: It was embarrassing to be doing acoustic music. Nobody did it. Everybody was rough. There was no pop going on at that time. Elliott and I used to play Peter Paul & Mary, Beatles, and Captain and Tennille covers together in the bedroom with the door closed, hoping nobody could hear us. I will never forget Neil laughing the first time Elliott played him a solo song, the part where his voice goes up on on “No Name #1”. Laughing. It was just shocking. 

I can't not acknowledge the fact that we are talking here about Portland, Oregon, in the 90s: This was O.H.—Original Hipster—so you had a lot of deeply ironic listening material like whale songs or Halloween Sound Effects records, or Tito Puente, or some Spanish movie soundtrack. And Portland itself is very rugged—there's a lot of Bad Company. [laughs] 

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: I remember one night we did karaoke with [Sleater-Kinney/Quasi's] Janet [Weiss] and [Smith bandmate] Sam [Coomes], and me and Janet did "Ride Captain Ride" together. Elliott might have done Rush.

ROB SCHNAPF [producer, Heatmiser’s Mic City Sons, along with Either/Or, XO, and Figure 8; married to Margaret Mittleman]: He actually did “Rock You Like a Hurricane” by the Scorpions. The look on Elliott’s face when he realized how high Klaus Meine’s voice is on that first note—the the realization of having miscalculated in public with a microphone in your hand—oh, it was good.

JJ GONSON: We were huge Elvis Costello fans, too. I remember sitting with Neil and Elliott in the living room at their house with our heads down listening to Brutal Youth. Amazing record. When Elliott was on tour, I went to see Elvis Costello and he was fucking furious. 

He would walk up behind me and put his arms around me and sing [the Carpenters'] "Close to You" to me. At one point when we were falling apart, he made me a beautiful cassette recording of the Cheap Trick song "If You Want My Love". I wish I knew where it was, but I don't.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: When I would tell the other bands I was working with that I was working with Elliott Smith, they’d be like, “Oh, why? That’s weird.” Eventually, of course, they became his biggest fans.


Between 1994 and 1996, Smith tours regularly as a solo artist while remaining the co-frontman of Heatmiser. 


SLIM MOON: A couple of the shows we played on that Roman Candle tour in 1994 were really poorly promoted, so we'd goof off, and Elliott would play a lot of Hank Williams and stuff. There was one show that was in a sports bar in Santa Cruz where there was no one there except the regulars, who were really bummed that we were bogarting their dartboard area. And I had really bad gas—I was farting up a storm. Elliott was cracking jokes about the smell in between songs, to the amusement of no one but me.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: Elliott’s first solo tour on the East Coast was painful because he was still becoming comfortable with performing alone—and not just alone, but alone to an empty room. He was nervous about it, and it used to make him… not feel good a lot. He dealt with a lot of stomach issues. So I'd always be the one telling him, “You can do it.” But whether it would be one person or five, somebody inevitably would discover him from that one experience, and the next time he went back, it was easier. 

ROB SCHNAPF: He used to play these shows and he wouldn’t finish songs and he would just kind of give up, and Margaret would be like, "Nope, you’re gonna go out there, you’ve gotta finish your songs, go back up the stairs." He'd say, "What if someone’s talking?" And she'd say, "Who cares? You wanna do this, right? Well, this is what you’ve gotta do. You’re gonna be playing this bowling alley in Nebraska next. Good luck."

MARY LOU LORD: [singer/songwriter; tourmate; KRS labelmate]: Slim really liked this kid. We were all together on a bill; me, Slim, and Elliott. I was backstage, just talking to everybody, and Slim said, “Mary Lou, you really need to go out and watch that guy.” I wasn't very interested; I had heard a million acoustic guitar guys, you know? But Slim was like, “No, Mary Lou, you really need to go and watch him.” In other words, “Shut the fuck up and get out there.” 

The first thing I noticed was that his guitar was really crappy; I think it might have been the Le Domino he recorded Roman Candle on. I realized he was making that crappy guitar sound really good. By the third song, I had completely lost myself. I was sucked in. I immediately invited him on tour. And he mumbled, in his way, “OK, Mary Lou.”


Watch Smith play "The Biggest Lie" live circa 1995; footage shot by Mary Lou Lord:







SLIM MOON: The biggest bands that Kill Rock Stars ever put out each got their momentum in a different way. Sleater-Kinney's biggest momentum was from the press—that, second to Radiohead, they got more positive press than any other band in America in the 90s. With the Decemberists, it was the public: The indie rock record-buyers, the kids, went crazy for that band, but critics kind of shrugged at the time. When Elliott Smith came out, it was falling on deaf ears. But artists were reacting to it. So there was a Fugazi interview where they mentioned that they'd heard the record and liked it. And then John Doe took Elliott on tour, and Sebadoh took Elliott on tour, and in a Beastie Boys SPIN interview, they mentioned his record.

LOU BARLOW [frontman, Sebadoh]: He opened solo for Sebadoh in ‘96, and it was at a time when no one really knew about him. We were at our peak at that point, and people just talked right through his set. It would make me really angry. I'd be like, "What the hell are you doing talking through his set? It's Elliott Smith! He's great!" I had that feeling like, “Someday you idiots will shut up and listen to him.” I remember telling him, "People won't shut up, it's making me so angry." And he's like, "I like it better this way. It makes me less self-conscious."

STEVEN DROZD [drummer/multi-instrumentalist, the Flaming Lips]: I met Elliott in '96. I was on that Sebadoh tour with Those Bastard Souls. I was very intimidated by him when I first met him. He just seemed like such a fucking serious dude. He was kind of a nobody back then, but he already had something about him. Between him and Lou Barlow, I was pretty struck. I treaded lightly. 

REBECCA GATES [singer/guitarist, the Spinanes]: We toured together for [The Spinanes’] Strand in 1996. I would never really sit down and play, except for during soundcheck and shows, but when we showed up anywhere, Elliott would just start playing guitar, whether he was writing, or practicing, or just playing covers. It wasn't like, "Here I am, check me out!" It was just to himself. He was someone who was always thinking about songwriting.

We were a pretty silly crew on tour. One time I was sitting shotgun in the van with my head in a book, and I heard all this snickering behind me. I turned around and [Elliott] had taken electric tape and made an Abe Lincoln beard on his face. And every time I kept turning around, more people had this electric tape facial hair.

MARY LOU LORD: We both applied to South By Southwest around 1995 and we got turned down. So I said, "Elliott, who are those assholes to tell us we can't play?" I had this little busking amp I kept in my car at all times, just in case. So we drove down there and found a little place to play near the Driskill Hotel. I kind of wore the pants on that tour [laughs], and Elliott was like, "I don't know about this, Mary Lou." And I was like, "That's enough outta you. We're going to have our own little showcase out in front of this Kinko's."

We got a bunch of booze and started playing. I wish to god somebody had recorded this, because it was St. Patrick's Day, and Elliott was playing all kinds of Irish songs and Pogues songs. We'd take turns, and we played all night and got happily shit-faced. The people who actually had a showcase at Kill Rock Stars came by; Slim was there. It was one of the best nights of my life.

SLIM MOON: It was particularly great at that time because her and Elliott had been touring together and were really tight. There was always a huge, huge circle of people around them.

MIKE DOUGHTY [frontman, Soul Coughing]: I saw Elliott in New York with the Magnetic Fields on the same bill. No one had heard of either them. It was literally a life-changing show. I was like, "I don't want to do Soul Coughing anymore. I want to do this—when I grow up, I want to be this man." I went out the next day to whatever groovy-people record store was closest and bought Roman Candle and Elliott Smith. 

The thing that I always keep in mind is the hiss from the tape on Elliott Smith; those were not sounds that an engineer would be particularly proud of. And there's some lyrics from "Christian Brothers" that I want to put up in neon across the length of Metropolitan Ave. in Brooklyn: "No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around." I'm getting chills right now just saying that.

I met him shortly after that. We were at [Manhattan venue] Brownie's and we were talking songwriting and records. At the time, he didn't do drugs, and I didn't drink, which kind of limited our hang. But I remember him saying, “Why are there no more drummers that just pound out the two and the four on the snare, like on old Sam Cooke records? Why do drummers have to be complicated?" And you can hear that on his records and in his own drumming. He hit the snare on the two and the four and then hit a ride cymbal every once in a while for emphasis. He didn't need some crazy attention-drawing drum part to make the song a song.

I just wanted to do something with him, and between Either/Or and XO, he came down to my studio. I sat him in front of a binaural head, which is this grey foam sculpture of a human head with two specialized microphones in each ear hole that has this incredibly realistic stereo effect. So we sat down in front of this ludicrous device and he sang two songs, which became other songs later—one was "The record that plays over and over/ There's a kid in the story below" lines from "Bottle Up and Explode!" The other one ended up as "Going Nowhere”. I didn't have anything good to add to them, but I have these a cappella versions. I wish I knew where I put them.

LOU BARLOW: I related to him in a lot of ways because when he was in the zone of performing acoustically, he was just hunched over. I mean, the guy didn't really ever look up. There was none of this, "I'm a performer," you know? Almost no acknowledgement. There was almost an anger that I really related to.

I remember he was soundchecking in Philadelphia at the Theatre of Living Arts. I would always watch his soundchecks, so I was sitting there, and he covered "Thirteen" by Big Star. It just brought me to tears. Music doesn't always bring me to tears; if I hear "Love" by John Lennon at a vulnerable moment it will bring me to tears. His version of "Thirteen" was devastating in that empty theater. I don’t think he even knew I was there.


Watch Smith cover Big Star's "Thirteen" at a Sydney, Australia, show in 1999:







DORIEN GARRY [friend, publicist at Girlie Action Media]: I first met him around 1995, when I was 17 or 18 and working the door at Maxwell’s. It was a Sunday night, and he was on tour with the Softies. Not very many people showed up to the gig. None of those guys had a place to stay, and I lived in kind of a halfway house for musicians in Jersey City at the time, so they stayed there for the night.

Totally coincidentally, within the next six months or so, I got hired at Girlie Action to do publicity and I worked for him. I handled the college fanzine stuff, and we became pretty close during that short span of time. Elliott and I both collected and read fanzines.

In the beginning, that part was actually sort of fun for him, because it was like a game. It took a long time for him to develop a love-hate relationship with the press room. So he would tell me a list of fanzines that he wished some day would interview him, and then we’d see if we could make it happen. That was such a different time in the music industry. There was no internet; fanzines were our internet—and using the post office was our information superhighway, I guess. [laughs]

Because we were friends, he was able to tell me what he was and wasn't comfortable with. The more attention he got, the more troubled he got, and that’s when it got hard. The irony of it was that he was so open and honest with pretty much anybody who crossed his path, so it wasn't unlike him to tell a very personal, private story to a virtual stranger sitting next to him at a bar.

But it would infuriate him when people asked him what his lyrics were about. He really hated having to have an answer for what every character and every story was. Music was a way of channeling thoughts and feelings that were bigger than him into art, and he didn’t feel like he owed every single person an explanation of what everything was about.

I mean, “Needle in the Hay” is obviously about drugs and despair. But I when I got to know him better, I learned that song was more about what was going on in the Pacific Northwest in the small music community in the early 90s and how badly drugs were infiltrating it.

LARRY CRANE: His lyrics are parables and observations. The biggest mistake people make is assuming his songs are all confessional. It's his own life, but it's a lot of allegory. You see recurring characters in his songs.

JJ GONSON: It always surprised me which pictures of mine that he loved. That one of people falling that's on the front of Elliott Smith—he loved that one, and I wouldn't have even noticed it.

REBECCA GATES: When I sang backup vocals on "St. Ides Heaven", he was so focused on how he wanted things to sound. I have a weird way of singing harmonies sometimes and I just remember him remarking on that: "Ah, I wouldn't have gone for that note, but it works great.” Maybe this has shifted now with digital recording, but the one thing that was really special about having those chances to record back then was that it didn't happen all the time. It was this really lovely space that you created. 

LOU BARLOW: When I would play Elliott's music in the house, my wife at the time was pissed. She's like, "This sounds like Sebadoh! It sounds like your acoustic stuff!" She was just livid about it. I couldn't really hear it, though; I heard much more of a folk tradition with him, and his music was more elaborate, where my stuff tended to be simpler.







Either/Or (1997)

Either/Or, Smith’s final album for Kill Rock Stars, is released on February 25, 1997. Portions of it are recorded at his then-girlfriend Joanna Bolme’s house; at Mary Lou Lord’s home studio; and in the basement of engineer/producer Larry Crane. Smith and Crane, after becoming friends, go onto build and open Jackpot! Recording Studio. 


LARRY CRANE: I kind of knew who Elliott was through Joanna [Bolme], because she worked at La Luna. We were throwing some random party, and everyone was sitting around the backyard having a barbecue. Joanna and Elliott were there, and that’s when I first remember showing them my home studio, and Elliott saying, "Oh, I have the same tape deck as you, maybe I could come over here and do some vocals over that." The next thing I know, we were tracking the vocals for “Pictures of Me”. When we recorded that song, I remember turning to him and saying, “Oh, you like the Zombies?"

We both wanted to go in on a studio together. I had this beat-up little Toyota pickup and we’d drive around Portland just looking through “For Rent” signs, listening to Simon & Garfunkel and the Left Banke. When we moved into the Jackpot! [Studio] space and started building it, we had a boombox with CDs and cassettes and we listened to all kinds of stuff: Television, the Saints. The only thing that drove him crazy was my obsession with Petula Clark. It didn’t really dawn on me for quite awhile that we were becoming friends.

We built the place in two weeks. Elliott was actually a professional mudder—he used to run around and do different jobs to do with mudding. And mudding is a pain in the ass. There's really an art to it, you have to be meticulous. I’m terrible at it. It was gonna be my studio, my business, my name, but he was gonna have a pro-rated deal. A lot of the people that helped do all the work—we had a big room, we had to put a wall up, paint, all that stuff—we just gave them recording time; you worked for an hour, you get an hour of recording time. We opened Jackpot! in February, 1997. 

Recording sessions were never really long and drawn out with him. Just three or four hours. If it wasn't going the right way, he'd say, "Make a rough mix of it for me, and let's go get a drink." Back then, it felt more like college than work. There was also a lot of silly stuff. One day, he must have seen someone wearing a Big Dog sweatshirt—that brand—and he must have thought it was really funny, because for no reason, he kept going around the studio puffing his chest out and repeating, “I'm a big dog.” He wouldn’t stop until it cracked us up.

Something else funny: A friend dropped off a Casio guitar made out of rubber, and I was supposed to give it to someone but I kept it around. And Elliott loved that thing. He would always strap it on and play, like, Stevie Wonder's “Superstition”. You can actually hear it on "Bled White”; it makes a neener-wheeee sound. He decided he had to bring it to L.A. to show Jon Brion.

DORIEN GARRY: He's been turned into somewhat of an icon, but he was actually a total goofball most of the time. He would prank call me and leave me voicemails. This was before cell phones, so I'd come home and there'd be a message that was him basically doing a whole Jerky Boys skit on the answering machine. 

And he had a real thing about clowns—being fascinated and intrigued by clowns, trying not be scared of clowns. It was a constant joke: Clowns are weird. Clowns are cool. Clowns are rad. When I saw that story recently about the scary clown in Northampton who’s been terrorizing people, the first thing I thought was, “Man, I wish Elliott was here for this.”

We watched All That Jazz together once. It was the rare night where I convinced him to stay home with me and not go out. We both loved it. The main character, who's wreaking havoc on this dance community, is wearing this black leather armband. Halfway through the movie, Elliott's like, "I really like that huge bracelet thing." I'm like, "Yeah, it's pretty badass." And then the next day he's like, "Do you know where I can go get a scrap of leather?" So that's basically where the whole leather armband trend of the 90s came from—Elliott seeing All That Jazz.

LARRY CRANE: We recorded a lot of cool stuff just incidentally. Someone would always be milling about, and then he'd just say, "Hey, can you help me track this?" That's actually how "Miss Misery" came about. He laid down the instrumental and then made a cassette of it. And then at some point he came back from out of town and said, “Hey, play us that one song.” And I’m like, “Which one?” But we put it up and he put all the vocals on it that day.

Whenever we did an early version of a song, he would say “I need to send out a probe." So we'd leave a track open just for him to hear and sing along. He would look for the notes that needed harmonies, and then we’d roll the tape and he’d sing them. He was obsessive about stuff like that. When we were tracking vocals for “Pictures of Me", I was amazed how many layers he built up. The music was all on two tracks, and the other six tracks ended up being vocals. I was like, "That's a little excessive!" [laughs]

I’ve seen very few people that are solo multi-instrumentalist artists that can really work that way. It was very much like a Brian Wilson thing where he locked in. He would be playing a song on guitar and then he’d say, “Maybe this would be better on piano.” And in a split-second he walks over and starts playing it on piano. 

ROB SCHNAPF: We recorded “Between the Bars”, “Angeles”, and “Say Yes” at [Schnapf and Rothrock’s Humboldt County, California, studio] the Shop. He would record one live take of vocal and guitar together, and then he would just double to it once we got it. It was just absurd. The guitar stuff isn’t even easy. It was ridiculous that he was able to just nail a vocal and guitar performance live, and he was able to double it live again. I mean, it’s not like he’s strumming G, C, D. There’s intricate little fills. It sounds so natural, and so simple—then you try to play it. And sing at the same time. He was just really good. Understated, but really good. 

I loved "Angeles". I was excited to be able to record it. We took that one organ note, which he had previously recorded, and looped it. It’s that one pedal tone, and it really felt like… something. I don’t always try to operate on the intellectual level; I like to keep it in the land of feelings and then think about it afterwards if I need to. Recording “Angeles” was a good feeling.

LUKE WOOD [DreamWorks A&R]: The most available example of Elliott's skill as a writer, and his way with metaphor, is probably "Between the Bars". It works on three layers. It's about love, at first, or it seems to be; you could look at it literally, being about going out for a night out at the bars; the imagery could easily be about prison; and, of course, it's potentially about addiction. The clarity and continuity of thought is amazing—he can take a metaphor like that and sing about it for three minutes and never leave.







JJ GONSON: He recorded Either/Or partly at my studio, which was a funny thing because, at that point, we weren't actually speaking to each other. But for months, he was next door to where I worked, so I could hear all these songs being made because my office shared a wall with where he was recording. It was hell. Good songs, though. Really good songs.

MARY LOU LORD: Honestly, I don't even know which songs for Either/Or he recorded at my house. [laughs] We had a room set up at my place, and he basically had a studio in it. Whenever he would come over, he would disappear into it for hours and hours, and we wouldn't disturb him. There were a lot of times where it was like, you know, "Where's Elliott?" And that's what he'd be doing. It was constant. He did that wherever he was; it wasn't just at my house.

JJ GONSON: That was around the time he was breaking away from Heatmiser. It's too bad, he wasn’t actually aware that you could have a conversation with somebody and say, "Look, I want to do some music that isn't Heatmiser, so I want to do this." Instead, he would just shut down and not say anything. So it was all done in this very underhanded way. I don't want to be disparaging of him, but this is just unfortunately how he operated. And then when we split up, I kept trying to juggle his solo career with the band, but I didn't have any communication at that point because he wouldn't let me talk to his manager [Margaret Mittleman]. Or he wouldn't let her talk to me. Or something. And the fact that he and I had broken up and were tearing each other into tiny little pieces emotionally—or at least he was tearing me, I can't speak for him—didn't help.

The way I looked at it: I managed Heatmiser. It was my place as their manager to make sure that they had shows to make money, and that things were scheduled properly, and that the relationship went well with all of our representatives, our label, our booking agent. As he did more and more solo shows, he disconnected from me and from the band. And I know that there were times where Elliott had songs that he wasn't taking to the band because I lived with him. 

It was hard for me as their manager because I knew there was something destructive going on, and I made a decision to support him as a musician and respect his wish that I didn't share this information. But I also knew that the band was done, because he wasn't willing to communicate. I couldn't make a rational decision about how best to manage that situation, so I just tried my best to keep things moving forward and get the bills and taxes paid.

Tony [Lash] and I were like: "We just have to keep it friendly, keep moving, get this record done." Because they had signed a contract with Virgin Records and they had obligations to fulfill. They were supposed to be supporting a record, so they booked a tour, and then Elliott bailed, as I recall. We're like, "What?!" This was after he and I had broken up, and he said, "I am prioritizing my solo career over the band." It was pretty shocking to everyone, because the band had worked really hard for a number of years. It could have been both.

TONY LASH: It was almost mid-tour with Heatmiser when he really wanted to change up the sound of the band. This might've been the genesis of struggles between the two of us, because I was resistant to that, but it was mostly because, as a drummer, I liked playing rock stuff; playing quieter music wasn't really my strong point back then, so I was hesitant. He was immediately frustrated. During that whole time, I remember enjoying playing concerts less, but thinking the music was a lot better. 

I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to Either/Or, because he was recording and finishing it just as tensions were highest. I still haven't really listened to that album. We went down to California to shoot a video for "Plainclothes Man" and I drove around with him and he played it for me. I thought it was good, but there was just a lot of tension at that point.

LOU BARLOW: Somehow, we ended up doing the overnight drive from Phoenix to San Diego together in his car when we were touring together. We just talked the whole time, and that was probably the closest I got to him at that point. At that time in Sebadoh, I was like, "I gotta kick the drummer out. This sucks. He's a really good friend." He'd had some issues moving forward from Heatmiser because those were his buds, and going solo was a big change for him. We discussed changing and sometimes leaving your friends behind for the sake of moving forward creatively and artistically. He was a really smart guy.

On the cover of Either/Or, he's standing in front of this mirror, and I was there the night that picture was taken; our tour manager took that picture, and she also took an identical picture of Sebadoh, with the exact same angle. I've gotta find that somewhere. 

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: When he opened for Mark Eitzel from American Music Club at Brownies in New York in ‘97. He finally got the room to be quiet. That was the big challenge; there was this core audience that would sit up front and be quiet, but at the bar people would be talking and the cash register would be going. There was a Troubadour show where people asked the bar not to ring up anything on the cash register during his set. You could hear a pin drop. That was the first time I remember the vibe being different. People weren't just there to see this next big thing. It was, “I need to see this guy.”

SLIM MOON: One of the side effects of his popularity as a solo artist, which also was a side effect of Heatmiser breaking up, was that Virgin no longer had this attitude like: "It's fine if he does this little solo thing on the side because it's not very important." Now that they thought of his solo career as valuable, he was really unhappy with Virgin, so he wanted to leave and go elsewhere. My own perception was that although it kind of sucks to be stuck in a contract you signed a long time ago, when you're having success, it gives you some leverage. I felt like it was a good problem to have; he may have just felt like it was a problem.







XO (1998)

In 1997, Elliott Smith is bought out of his Virgin contract by DreamWorks. He settles into Sunset Studio, on Sunset Boulevard—the studio where Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street, Led Zeppelin II and IV, and Beck's Odelay were recorded , among others—with producers Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock to begin sessions for XO, his DreamWorks debut.  


LUKE WOOD: Someone gave me Roman Candle from Cavity Search when it came out. I was just starting to do A&R in the record business, and I remember being in my Volvo 240 in Silverlake, which is every bit the cliche it sounds like, sitting in front of my house playing the songs over and over again. It was the punkest record I had heard in so long. He played it on an acoustic guitar, but the lyrics were so intense, and his voice was so believable. At the time, if I remember correctly, he was listed under his birth name of Steven Smith. I called him up; I was working at Geffen Records at the time, and he was in Heatmiser. He was really sweet and very appreciative, but said, "I'm cool, thank you very much." I didn't speak to him again until maybe 1997. By then, I was pretty much fanatical. Elliott Smith and Either/Or had come out, and both of those were my favorite records of those respective years. So when I went to DreamWorks to start my A&R career, Elliott was foremost on my mind. 

LENNY WARONKER [DreamWorks co-CEO]: Tom [Rothrock] and Rob [Schnapf] came to see me when we first started DreamWorks. They played us Elliott Smith, among other things. It was something from Either/Or, I think, and I said, "What the hell is that?" Just the sound of his double-tracked voice and the acoustic guitar was so unique—maybe there was some George Harrison in there, but what he was doing was uniquely his. And they said, "No, that's not available."

It was pretty much predetermined that he was gonna move from Heatmiser, but there was still the Virgin/Capitol part, and Elliott had to sort of do that himself. He had a contractual obligation there, both as Heatmiser and as a solo artist. I had a meeting with Margaret and the President of Capitol Records, Gary Gersh, who was very cool. He didn't want to force somebody to stay with him. He knew how great Elliott was, and did what he could to keep him, but he didn't want to do it over a gun.

Later on, Margaret, Elliott, and I met for lunch. The first 40 minutes of that meeting were really rough because he's so shy and doesn't say much. He had an orchestration book under his arm and I actually pointed to it said, "What do you have there?" That opened the conversation and then it was a good solid hour of talking about music and some of the artists that I had been associated with that really affected him. He was saying, "I'm gonna start thinking about using an orchestra on my record." He was testing my response, I think. So I went into my Randy Newman and Van Dyke Parks speech about how interesting it is when you orchestrate and go beyond just rock, and I think that pushed some of his concerns aside. I mentioned the right artists, and he relaxed. 

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: It definitely started with Lenny. Elliott felt good knowing it was one of the top guys behind him, because it was a big, big jump.

ROB SCHNAPF: Here’s the thing about Either/Or: It could easily have been bigger-sounding. We could have blown it up more, but he wasn’t ready to do it just yet. He was heading that direction, though. Elliott never did anything he didn’t want to do. With XO, we didn’t have any specific conversation about it, but I could tell: He was just ready. 

TONY LASH: Maybe he kept things low-key in the beginning as a deliberate way to distinguish his solo material from Heatmiser. I can only speculate, but it seemed like that to me. So, freed from the constraints of Heatmiser, he could incorporate whatever he wanted into his songs.

LENNY WARONKER: He never felt intimidated musically and he was quite open about things in the studio. We didn't stop by often, but when I was there, if I had a thought—even if it was bad—he would listen. It was almost like he was taking notes. I made some reference to the Beach Boys at one point, suggesting the possibility of adding an odd instrument, maybe a woodwind, and rather than either file it away or just go "no," he was intrigued by it.

The harmonies and the vocal parts were so much more predominant on XO, and that gift, along with all the other gifts that he had, was a surprise. It shouldn't have been; you could tell from his earlier records that it was there, but not to that degree. He completely stepped up. I was so taken by what he was doing. 

His stuff was always so precise. Most great songwriters are very economic, and he was, outside of Randy Newman... well, I shouldn't say it this way. But he was as good as it gets when you're talking about layers within lyrics. There was so much in it with so few words, and as fragile he sounded, he was in complete command. 

ROB SCHNAPF: He was brisk in the studio. Speed was never the focus, but at the end of day one we had “Waltz #1” basically done. We came back the next day and added that big old bass drum to it, and added strings to it after that, but the meat of the song—vocals, everything—was done.

Songs would just come up. Maybe they weren’t necessarily written in the studio, but they'd be written while we’re making the record. It’s hard for me to say exactly what the deal is, but in this case there was a convergence of inspiration and it made something happen. A lot of times, I think he had stuff kicking around for years. His dad had told me they were very similar in that way, because his dad was a painter. He was like, "I work on a painting and then I put it away for 10 years, and all of a sudden I know how to finish it." So he carried bits around.

TONY LASH: There was a song on XO that was probably the best song we did, as Harum Scarum, back in 1989 or 1990. He reworked it for XO, and turned it into "Everybody Cares, Everybody Understands". The old song was called "Catholic". That was surprising to me. I think he ended up doing more of that later, pulling out really old ideas and reworking them.

LARRY CRANE: I was there when they did the horns and string overdubs on XO. They brought [string arrangers] Shelly Berg and Tom Halm in to flush out the ideas that Elliott had played out on a keyboard the week before. He gave them the MIDI files and talked to them about what he wanted, and they went and arranged it and played us these synthetic strings, as a mockup. Elliott was silent the whole time. Then we shake hands and say “OK, we’ll see you at the string session in a couple days." The minute we're back in the suite, Elliott turns to me and says, "Oh man, I don't like what he added, but I don't want to offend the guy." And Tom [Rothrock] overheard that and was like, "Wait a minute, what did you say to Larry!?" So we march back there, and Elliott tells them what he doesn't like, and Shelly says, "Yeah, you basically stripped it back to what you gave us in the first place.”

I’m a lot more cavalier, I guess; if it’s a hired-gun arranger, and I have to change or throw away what they're doing, I don’t give a fuck—the only thing that matters is if the artist is happy and the record comes out as good as we can make it. I was blown away that he would even half-think that way. He just didn’t want to ever have an issue or conflict or bum other people out, but by doing that, ironically, he usually bummed people out anyway. He could be really stern with me, and he would be stubborn, within Heatmiser, about what he wanted. 


Watch the video for XO's "Baby Britain":







Around this time, Smith contributes the original song “Miss Misery” to the Good Will Hunting soundtrack. Soon after XO sessions are underway, they are interrupted by the news that the track has been nominated for an Oscar.


GUS VAN SANT [director, Good Will Hunting]: I knew about Heatmiser, and I saw them one time at Pine Street [later changed to La Luna], which was the center of a lot of alternative bands during the 80s. But I didn't really know too much about their music. Mostly I had these these two CDs from my friend Steve Birch, who worked for a lot of bands because he was an artist and designed covers. He’d picked up a bunch of CDs for me from this store called Locals Only around 1994, and Roman Candle was in the pile. Elliott’s music was something I just happened to put on at one point. It reminded me of Simon & Garfunkel. Although, before I met Elliott, someone said, “Don't mention Simon & Garfunkel to him.”

As I do with most films, I try and find some music that you could use throughout, not just a sampling of lots of different artists. And I thought it might be interesting to try that with Elliott. I told the editor, Pietro Scalia, who's now one of the most expensive editors in Hollywood, to try his music and it just worked. As soon as we decided we really did want it for sure, the next step was to ask Elliott whether that was OK. My boyfriend worked with Joanna in a bar, so he got me the number and I just called him up.

LARRY CRANE: I was out running errands or doing something, and I come back around and Elliott goes, “Oh, Gus Van Sant came over and I played him that song we recorded.” And I’m just like, “What! I wasn’t here?!" 

JJ GONSON: I remember hearing vaguely about Good Will Hunting, early on. I knew Gus was in town, I think. Elliott and I weren’t speaking much by then. He started dating Joanna and just as I was his world, she was now his world. I certainly didn't hang out with him. We were not friends at that point.

LARRY CRANE: The studio asked if we had anything original and unreleased we could put in there, and we played them "Miss Misery", and they thought it was great. Later, I was in the middle of a session, and I got this phone call like, “This guy’s going to show up to grab the tape.” They put a guy on a plane in L.A., and he flew up, and got in a limo—it wasn’t just a goddamn cab, it was a limo—and pulled up in front of the studio later that same day. He grabs that one reel, jumps in the car, and goes back to the airport to fly back to L.A. What a joke. 

Rob Schnapf and Tom [Rothrock] remixed the song down there, and then they basically had to pretend that it had been written for the movie in order to get an Oscar nomination. Elliott couldn't say it was actually tracked before he'd even heard of Good Will Hunting! It doesn’t matter now, you know? [laughs] 

SLIM MOON: Either/Or came out in February of '97, and Good Will Hunting came out later that year. But I had put out a lot of expensive records all in one year, and had kind of overdone it, and we were a small operation. It was just three of us in an apartment, and I didn't have any line of credit or anything. I had gotten myself in a situation where I owed the manufacturer of the records a tremendous amount of money, and it was going to be four months before I started to see money trickling in from all of it. I had really screwed up.

So I was in my bedroom at the Las Vegas Hilton, of all places, at the National Association of Recording Merchandisers convention—I wasn't there just gambling away the money that I didn't have [laughs]—when Elliott's publisher called me and said he'd been nominated for an Oscar. That saved our business.

ROB SCHNAPF: I remember going into the studios and doing vocals and piano on “Miss Misery” pretty early in on XO, and all of a sudden he gets nominated for an Oscar and it just changes everything. It became really hard for him because, for one, he’s playing everything, so he never has a break: Elliott plays drums, then plays bass, then plays guitar, then plays piano, then sings. And before that, he would have interviews from like 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. talking to people, international press, all over the place.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: All of a sudden, he had to do interviews for Us and People and all these magazines that wouldn’t have touched him. And they don't care who you are. They just want to talk about this one song. We were trying to focus on recording XO, but my memory of that time is all about just getting him to sit down in the lounge of Sunset Sound to do interviews. 

GUS VAN SANT: As soon as the nominations came out, all of us were assigned different campaign duties. Elliott played in a little club in TriBeCa near the Weinstein Company, which was partly organized by the movie promotion. It was just a simple thing, but it wasn't his own thing, so he was all nervous. He didn't really know what to wear, so he just put on some slacks. With his schedule, he didn't have a place to change, so he changed on the subway platform and got reprimanded by a cop.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: We had to go to Capitol Studios and rehearse with the orchestra for the Oscar performance. They were impressed with his knowledge working with an orchestra and writing out his piece. We had a trailer, which was a trip to him. We saw the stage and what the audience was going to look like; there were all the signs on the chairs saying who was going to sit where. 

They were trying to figure out how he would come out, how to make him perform. They wanted him to sit on the set of stairs that everyone would walk up to get to the podium, and we tried that. They really wanted him to be the guy who comes out and sits on the stairs. I walked out to [Oscars producer] Gil Cates, kind of shaking and saying, “I’m sorry, that can’t happen. He’s not going to do that.” Elliott wouldn’t say anything, so I had to do all that, which was very stressful.

ROB SCHNAPF: It was scary because they were like, “We want you to play with a rope as a guitar strap.” “Nah, I don’t want to do that.” “Well that’s what we want you to do.” “Well, I don’t want to do that.” “I want you to sit on the steps.” “Nah, I don’t want to do that.” There was this feeling: “Well, we’re the Oscars, who are you?”

LARRY CRANE: The Oscars people came to Margaret and said he’s only going to be playing a verse and a chorus, and Elliott was like, “I don’t want to do it then." Simple as that. So they said they’d just get someone else to play his song: “Here’s Billy Joel!” Or it’s Matt Damon in a top hat.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: The day of the ceremony, me, Rob, Joanna, and Elliott pulled up to where all the limos were pulling up, and I was trying to figure out how to get Elliott down the red carpet, which was chaotic. The four of us started to walk down one side, but Rob and I got pulled away, like, “This is the side you go on.” The photographers were just trying to figure Elliott out. Nobody knew who he was.

GUS VAN SANT: He had a white suit, and it was kind of amazing. As soon as the curtains parted, I saw that the entire stage was decorated as the Titanic. I thought, "Oh, I see." Hollywood was so excited that they had a movie that grossed a billion dollars and they were gonna show it. So Celine Dion had a full orchestra. Elliott had a little bit of an orchestra, too, but it was all very tiny in comparison. They used a lot of fog for the show, presumably because it was the Titanic, and it made me very sick—three hours of that stuff blowing on you and you just get a severe hangover.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: We met Matt Damon and Minnie Driver. Minnie started hanging out with him after that—I think they may have had a little thing for a while. I don’t know if it was anything serious, or if she just got into his music. Then there was the Governors Ball dinner that everybody goes to right after the whole event ends, which was pretty hilarious. We sat with Fay Wray, who was in the original King Kong. Elliott met that guy who played the detective in Jackie Brown, Robert Forster, too.

But the highlight of that event for Elliott was that Celine Dion made him feel comfortable, from backstage to onstage. It really was amazing. She made him really feel at home, like he was one of them.

ROB SCHNAPF: Celine Dion was really awesome to him. She really was.


Watch Smith perform "Miss Misery" at the Oscars in 1998:







LARRY CRANE: I knew it had no chance in hell of winning. I was hoping it would, but come on; it’s up against the song from Titanic. It’s funny, the woman I’m married to now was my friend at the time, and she came and picked me up and we went and watched the Oscars at La Luna. We had so much history with Elliott and Joanna there, and it was awesome because it was queer night at La Luna, so we went and watched it with all these wonderfully raging queens, who were like, “Oh look, there she is, oh my god, she’s beautiful!” whenever someone came onstage.

GUS VAN SANT: The Oregonian wrote a really catty review of the Oscars saying they were boring, and that Elliott's appearance was “grunge lite.” They were just making fun of the whole thing. But through all the sort of showbiz-y stuff associated with the Oscars, he was happy that it was the one thing that his mother could tell her friends her son had done. He was a singer, yes, but now he'd been nominated for an Academy Award. He was really happy.

We mostly went our separate ways after that. I went to a show at the El Rey and, I think because I was a movie guy, I was always looked at like, "What's this guy doing here? Who the fuck does he think he is?" I didn't find a comforting home in his music crowd.

REBECCA GATES: If one of your friends is suddenly performing on the Oscars, there's a sense that something's shifted: a shift in opportunities, a shift in who's paying attention. I just loved that he was hanging out with Celine Dion. He was like, "Hey guys, you get so many weird gifts when you go the Oscars." He felt weird about it; it was a cool thing, but it was a weird thing. There's a part of being good friends where you try to keep things normalized.  We just said, "You looked hilarious up on stage. You did a good job, it was excellent."

DORIEN GARRY: He had tremendously low self-esteem, so it was very awkward for him to all of a sudden be revered by so many strangers. Ultimately, I think that was the hardest and most confusing thing for him. He couldn't understand what the big deal was, I guess.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: There was definitely a pace with Elliott, like, “We’ll get there. Can we just take it a step at a time?” It was my job to get everybody on board with that. He eventually did everything he was supposed to do. Most of it he knew he wouldn’t like, but he did it. Lenny and Luke never really complained.

LUKE WOOD: He was extremely reluctant about promotion in general, but it wasn't because he thought he was too good for it, or because he thought it was selling out. It was really because he felt like the music should speak for itself, and everything else was redundant and irrelevant and silly. “Why do I talk about ‘Waltz #2’? Listen to the song!” He really believed what the song meant to you is what it meant.

I think what Elliott wanted out of his situation was the capital afforded from a major label, because there were things he wanted to do creatively. He tried to find the place that had the most patience and would fuck with him the least; he never wanted to feel like he was singing for his supper. I will say, I felt like he did enjoy the shows. He was reluctant occasionally, when the monitors weren't great or something else was off, because he was a perfectionist and that stuff would drive him crazy. But he'd often come back after a show with a smile on his face and say, "That was fun tonight, I really enjoyed it." 

STEVEN DROZD: We ended up doing some shows in Sweden together with Elliott playing with his full band around '99. I was in pretty bad shape at that point, but we just really hit it off, and next thing I knew we were getting drunk and playing acoustic guitars on his tour bus, driving through Sweden. As miserable as I was on tour at that time—I was really strung out and I couldn't get anything in Scandinavia, and I was going two or three days without really sleeping—he and I would drink whiskey and play Elton John and Big Star songs at four o'clock in the morning on the tour bus. It was incredible.

He and I did ecstasy on the tour bus one night and we were listening to Elton John's Greatest Hits. His favorite was actually "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road", so we played that one a lot. My favorite Elton John song is "Daniel"; my son is named Daniel and he's partly named after my wife's father, but also partly named after that song. So we get to that song and Elliott stops it, and I'm like, "Hey, what are you doing?" He says, "Man, I never liked that fuckin' song. Who is this fuckin' Daniel guy, anyway." I try to tell him it's this character whose brother had been to Vietnam, and how they cut out the last verse because it was too weird, trying to sell him. He wasn't having any of it. "I don't give a shit! Fuck 'Daniel', we're skipping 'Daniel."







Figure 8 (2000)

In 1999, as touring for XO winds down, Smith begins working on what would eventually become its ambitious follow-up, Figure 8.


AUTUMN DE WILDE [photographer, cover art and inserts for Figure 8; director, “Son of Sam” video; author of the 2007 photo book Elliott Smith]: We first met because I knew his manager, Margaret Mittleman. Later, we met on the street in New York and hung out that whole night. Someone had spray painted “freak” in a bunch of places in New York, and he thought it was funny, so the next morning, I took some pictures of him standing in front of the word “freak.” It was a very unofficial beginning. I was in no way pursuing work.

A bunch of time passed and then my manager asked me to submit my portfolio, which was mostly photos of my friends, for Figure 8; I had a photo of Steve Malkmus from being on tour with them, and some photos of Beck, and probably the Eels. Then, at the back of that book was a photo of him, and he realized whose portfolio he was looking at.

One of my first questions was: “Do you want to change anything about how you're portrayed?” He immediately said, "I feel like everybody thinks I just want to sit in little dark rooms and look depressed in my photos. There's never any color or light, but I love color so much." We talked about all the things he loved, like French New Wave. He was a cinephile and he had a great taste in movies. 

He also mentioned being sick of his own clothes, so I said, "Since this is accidentally your uniform because you didn’t want to dress up for photos, maybe we should put you in suits, but it should look like someone's suit who has been gambling for days and sleeping in it, the kind of suit that is a man’s uniform, not someone dressing up." I was really inspired by photos of the "Forgotten Man" during the Depression, when men were wearing the last suit that they had at the time, just trying not to starve to death. It's the kind of suit that is worn in the rain and shrinks on the body and becomes a second skin, which is different than someone who willfully dropped out.

At the time, I wasn’t thinking about the fact that he wore a suit in the "Miss Misery" video or at the Oscars. I was trying to come up with a way for him put on clothes that expressed an idea without feeling, like, “Elliott Smith is changing his image." He wasn’t worried about that, but I was. I didn’t want it to seem like I messed with something that didn't need messing with. 

It soon became clear to me that I wasn’t dealing with someone who was worrying about how he looked, but rather someone who was making sure whatever it was we were doing was telling the right story: looking at what all these photos mean; not taking them if they don’t mean anything; making them have the right relationship with this record. That was the beginning of me feeling very lucky to be working with him.

I was warned by Margaret that he probably only wanted to do the photoshoot for a few hours, and that I should try to get as many photos as I could. But we shot for like 12 hours. People always said that he didn’t like having his photo taken, but I think he didn’t like the process as it had been presented to him up until that point. With us, it was a creative process, and he really enjoyed it; it wasn’t just about 400 photos of Elliott Smith.

LUKE WOOD: Elliott was living in my neighborhood in Silverlake at the time, and he demoed some of the Figure 8 songs at my house, because I had a small studio. He'd be there during the day while I was at work, and I would get to come home and hear these things as they came together, and literally look at his sketchpads of lyrics. Figure 8 is a very specific record. Just like XO, it's different lyrically and slightly more esoteric, but he had a real idea of what he wanted to say.

It was such a joy watching the thought he would put into small things as he wrote: Should it be "to" or should it be "at?" Should it be first-person or second-person? Should this be plural or singular? Where should I put the modifier? He would write five different versions of a sentence, only changing the modifier. His music was unbelievably well-thought-out.

AUTUMN DE WILDE: As far as the cover, I was trying to figure out how to bring color in without it feeling manufactured and artificial in his world. I said, “What if you are who you are, but you’re walking in front of something that doesn't match, like when you are having an argument with someone in front of a really colorful mural.” I grew up in L.A., so I had my first kiss with someone I loved in a parking lot of a Denny’s in Hollywood, and that became a symbol of our love. So I went out to take some pictures of locations. 

I went to a junior high down the street from the Figure 8 wall—well, now it's the Figure 8 wall; then it was The Sound Solutions wall. I have childhood memories of girls getting beat up in the parking lot of the McDonald's next to it. I took photos of a lot of murals and weird signs from Echo Park to Silverlake and asked him, "What if this was our set?" He loved that idea because it was like seeing something he saw every day and didn’t realize how amazing it was, which is a very Los Angeles thing: When you start narrowing your vision to one thing at a time, you start seeing little gems in the Los Angeles landscape.

ROB SCHNAPF: Figure 8 was recorded all over the place, not all at once. XO got really hard to do because of him playing everything, so for Figure 8  I said, "When you have a batch of songs, let me go record them. We can do it in two-week spurts, that way it’s not this huge, epic burden on you." There was one batch where he did it all, another batch where Sam [Coomes] was more involved playing bass. Then we were in England at Abbey Road, and [drummer] Joey Waronker happened to be in town with R.E.M. and we cut a bunch of songs [with him].

I had never been to Abbey Road before then, and I haven’t been back since. On one hand, it’s just a studio. But then I’m moving the U47 [microphone] around and I'm like, "Wow, it’s got those pop filters just like in the Beatles book… oh, wait." All the same shit is in there. The whole week we were there there was this upright piano that sounded so familiar when you played it. I bugged the assistant and he would never tell me anything, but finally he relented and was like, “Uh, 'Penny Lane.'” And not only is it “Penny Lane”, it’s all those songs where you hear that tack piano—and not only Beatles stuff, like “Martha My Dear”. It’s also Odessey and Oracle and Pink Floyd and tons of others. When I got back home and started listening to records, I’m like, "There’s that piano again." I have a picture of it on my refrigerator. 

As it developed, I noticed that Figure 8 was less literal but more impressionistic lyrically and also texturally. There were parts of it that were a little more ethereal. For this record, I wanted to see what he would do with the Boomerang looper, which is a simple thing to make loops. I showed him how to use it and then all of a sudden I had all these little interlude pieces. So while Tom [Rothrock] and I were working on something that required Elliott, he’d be out making those loops, and we’d just use them as segues to get to different things. One turned into a song called “Dancing on the Highway”, which didn't make the record. It’s a really cool song. 

AUTUMN DE WILDE: He requested me to direct the "Son of Sam" video. I was shocked and I think DreamWorks was pretty shocked, too. I hadn’t directed a video before. To their credit, they rolled with it. It was inspired by La Jetée and The Red Balloon. I would never try to get rid of the sadness that was connected to his songs, but there is so much more in them—so much great poetry that represented abstract and direct ways of explaining how you feel to someone. Not everything was a diary. Some of it was role-playing, becoming other people and singing from their point of view.

For Elliott and I, the best part of this video was how funny it was trying to get this balloon to behave. If it was windy we were fucked, you know? I later found out that The Red Balloon had this giant puppeteering crane. Luckily, we did a test day. Somewhere, there is a clip of Elliott slapping his arms in dismay and being overwhelmed by the balloon hitting him in the face for like the 70th time. It was on one of those giant stairways in Echo Park that I think was in a Laurel and Hardy film, and he's at the top. He was just looking really pissed off, like he was gonna get in a fight with the balloon, and then laughing, and then angry again. The art director figured out you had to use fishing poles, and you can see it in one shot. At the end of the video, when the balloon dies, we all got really sad—and then we were laughing hysterically at how attached we had gotten to this badly behaved actor.







TONY LASH: I didn't really dive into Figure 8 very deeply. I could feel the emotional remove when I heard it, and I really didn't like that. XO still seemed more emotionally engaged. I remember telling him that I thought "Waltz #1" was my favorite song on XO, and he was like, "Yeah, that's the best one." That was a nice little re-bonding moment. Then the sound of Figure 8 was like: "Here's a bunch of really good chord changes and notes." But it was missing that feeling of him directly engaging.

DORIEN GARRY: That was the period where things got unhealthy for him physically. He had someone on his crew that was a bad influence. Not someone in his band, but someone who was working for him, who was notorious for getting musicians drugs and doing them with them. It was around the same time that the relationship he’d had cut him off from people for a while. I mean, I knew what a lot of that record was written about, and by that point everything felt so over the top and overwhelming that it was a little bit hard for me to just sit back and enjoy the music. Elliott definitely channelled whatever was wrong in his life or upsetting to him into his music like tenfold.

LOU BARLOW: I saw him at a party in L.A., and he was actually a really good croquet player. I learned croquet from Elliott. Anyway, I said something like, "I think I'm drinking too much." And he's like, "Well, can you feel your liver?" "What do you mean?" "When you drink too much, you can feel your liver literally pulsing from your side." I was poking for it, trying to feel it, and he's like, "Can you feel it?" And I'm like, "No! Where is it?" He's showing me where it is and telling me when it gets really bad, it pops out the side. I think it's something his dad had told him. I was like, "Man, I guess I'm really not that hardcore of a drinker—my liver isn't protruding from my chest."

ROB SCHNAPF: When he was on top of his game, none of that was happening. Did he drink? Yes. But when I go back and think about it, it started happening during Figure 8. It was not in the open. He was definitely not sharing it. But in retrospect, it explained some things. 

JJ GONSON: He wasn't doing any drugs or really drinking very much when we were together. A big part of what tore us apart was talking about wanting to do drugs. I was like, "I just can't be around that." He didn't want me to tell him what not to do. 

DORIEN GARRY: There were a lot of people in Elliott's life during different times. I'm a lucky one in the sense that our friendship managed to stretch across many different phases, whereas a lot of people sort of got cut off or just were not part of it anymore. I maintained a friendship  with him until he died. I mean, I live in Los Angeles now, and I'm not a fan of probably 75% of the people that call themselves Elliott's friends from L.A. I know the ones that are for real, who had healthy friendships with him. I'm always a little bit torn about speaking publicly about him—losing a friend like that is one of the most difficult things that's ever happened in my life. But if I don't do it, you know… the people who are eager and willing to talk are usually not the right people.

From the very beginning, we had a sibling relationship. I met him when I was 18, and you don't really understand a lot of things in the world when you're 18. Emotionally, he was the most vulnerable person I'd ever met at that point. We took care of each other during not-so-fun times in our lives. I never cast judgment on him. I had to figure out a way to be concerned when there were moments to be concerned; there was a way to approach him about it, and a way not to. I think he appreciated the fact I was never going to do it the way he didn't want to hear.

Elliott wasn’t a typical alcoholic or drug addict in the sense that they try to keep it secret from people. He was very honest about what was going on. If there's one thing Elliott was not it's a liar. It was hard. I don't know which is worse: being deceived or having it just be all out in the open like that. It was very, very upsetting to know that somebody I cared about so much was doing something so stupid.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: As things got bigger, I probably talked to him less. My job had changed a little bit; I became a parent. I hired a friend who became my point person for Elliott. I would take the big-picture meetings with him, but as far as, like, "Can you deliver this list of interviews he doesn't want to do, please?" I stopped doing that. At the time, it was like “OK, you stress me out, and I’m stressing you out. Let’s have other people talk to each other and get our message across. I’ll deliver it to her, she’ll deliver it to you.” That just became easier, and I didn’t see anything wrong with that.

But somewhere in there, we lost him. I have my reasons and my thoughts of outside influences, where I feel like a parent, like, “Oh, if only they hadn’t met that person.” As if it were that person’s fault. There were a couple of people who I wish we hadn’t had in his circle at the time, in retrospect.

I became blind to a lot of things. I didn’t know, but other people around me knew. The Rolling Stone[-sponsored tour] didn't seem super fun for him, but he seemed fine. He was doing everything he was supposed to do, but it was a corporate sponsor, you know? All these corporate people at the shows. Not Rolling Stone people, corporate people. They were nice, but it was different: It wasn't a fan, it wasn't me, it wasn't Rob. And then he did the European tour. I was supposed to go on a bunch of those dates, but I cancelled. He just was not pleasant, and I didn't want to be around it. I was supposed to go to Japan and I didn’t. I just wanted him to get through all of it. In hindsight, I see what was happening. He came home a mess.

AUTUMN DE WILDE: His behavior was becoming more erratic. He’s not the first person I’ve experienced this with, where drugs overtake the personality after a certain point. That’s when you see that there is nobody who is enough of an individual to be an individual on drugs—even the most original person on earth, which I think he was. Some people hold onto their friends when they’re sick like that, and some people systematically try to destroy their relationships in order to not drag them down with them. I don’t know how much credit I should give him, but I felt like he systematically destroyed his relationship with anyone he really respected and cared about. Whatever was left of him did not want us around while he was totally down there.

He wasn’t really hiding anything, either, in my opinion. So that meant you were either there to condone it or you were not there to condone it. And I was not there to condone it. The people who are there to condone it—and this was a very common event—are disposable to someone like that, and they become enablers because they’re there for what they need.

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: I thought it was time to get off DreamWorks. I met with Anti- [Records] at the time, because I had a good friend there and felt that he could earn money from other outside activities: Remember when the Gap was doing those commercials using musicians in the late 90s? There was interest in Elliott. And this big movie producer, Brad Silberling, was asking him to score a film. I just thought, "There's a million other things you could be doing. You're gonna be fine.” 

We had tried once to have an intervention in Chicago, [circa the Either/Or tour]. Oh my god. He hated us. He never let me forget what I did to him. We’d be having a great conversation, and it would just come up again out of nowhere. It totally reminds me of the child in him, or my own kids, how they hold onto one memory of mom and dad fighting at dinner. He never let me forget how betrayed he felt. He did agree to go. I think he felt the love and the concern, but you just don't do that to him. That’s what he was like: “I’m a different person. You could have dealt with it differently.” 

I visited him at the rehab place in Pasadena, maybe a month after. He finished up the leg of the tour to New York and then went. It was just weird. It felt like there was a difference between he and I. 

Years later, when he started hanging out with Jon Brion wanting to do work with Jon and not Rob is where the lines really got blurred. This would have been around 2001. I just wanted what was best for my husband and for Elliott. By then, he was a different person. Honestly, he wasn’t really nice to me. He came over one day during the Super Bowl—he used to spend every Super Bowl with us—and he looked like Pocahontas. He had long hair, in braids. I just didn’t know him anymore. His girlfriend Valerie [Deerin] came over—that’s another person that should have never been in his life—and he told Rob he wanted to work with Jon Brion.

That was heartbreaking. I didn’t like the delivery; I didn’t like his choice of day, because that was something we’d done together. That was the beginning of the end for me. He came over fucked up with my kids in the house, and I just shut down. I just wanted to protect my husband and my family and myself. And when I quit, that pissed him off. That’s the part that can make me cry. There was no closure. We never got to argue. We never got to hash it out. I was more like, “Just get out of here.” I never was invited to his funeral. His drug abuse had turned him into something he wasn’t when I knew him all these years. 

ROB SCHNAPF: When it happened, he was all fucked up. I had already kind of told him I don’t approve: "You want to smoke crack or whatever, that’s your free will, great. I don’t want to be around it. That’s my decision."

DORIEN GARRY: At one point I probably hadn't heard from him for about four or five months—he wasn’t calling back, and it was pretty upsetting. The day after September 11th, I came back into the house to an answering message from him. He didn't sound like himself—I mean, everybody sounded weird after September 11th, but I knew that things were pretty dark for him at that point. But his message was asking if everyone was OK, talking about how he’s taken the train and gotten off at the World Trade Center, how he’d  done it over a million times. That meant a lot to me. But then I couldn’t get a hold of him again for a long time. He was in a relationship that cut him off from a lot of people at the time. It was really terrible because I’d known him through some dark times already, but he always, always reached out.

SCOTT BOOKER [manager, Flaming Lips; briefly managed Smith]: [The Flaming Lips] did a few dates in Europe with Elliott around '99, and we all got along really great. After that I got a call from him like, "Hey, would you be interested in being my manager?" I was like, "Of course, who wouldn’t? You’re a genius." I didn’t really know what I was getting into. In our first conversation, he was like, "I want off DreamWorks." 

He didn’t want to record for them anymore because he was convinced that they had people following him, that they were breaking into his house, those kinds of things. Which we all know wasn’t true. But I’d be like, “Well, Elliott, I’m not gonna say I don’t believe you, but why don’t we get one of those cameras that you can buy for like five bucks and you take pictures of any car or person that is following you.” And he said, “Well, the cars have blank license plates.” I never said, "I don’t believe you." I tried to be pragmatic and realistic. He even said to me, “Well, it’s probably not really there.”

When the Flaming Lips played a show in L.A. one time, I remember him calling me saying, “DreamWorks are at my house, because my Flaming Lips backstage pass was upside down on the floor." I was like, "Maybe you just dropped it." I was afraid to say those things, but I’d say it casually. And he was like, "No, I remember putting it on my desk.” He’d have a very elaborate reason as to why. It just wasn’t worth arguing with him.

Even though I didn’t think his reasons were sound, I thought I should still let the label know he’s uncomfortable being there and let them have a part of the decision as well. So I went and had a meeting with Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood. I said, "Look, I don’t think this is a good idea for Elliott to not be on DreamWorks, and I know you guys love him, but for whatever reason, he’s uncomfortable with this. What do you guys wanna do?"

Lenny came up with a pretty elegant solution. He was like, "Let’s not say he’s off the label, let’s just let him put this next record out wherever he wants to, as long as it's not another major label." I thought that was very fair of them and I liked that they weren’t going to just drop him. It solved the dilemma of that moment. 

I mean, just think about me as the manager going into Lenny Waronker, this legendary, artist-friendly music-industry person I’ve looked up to my whole life, to go in and saying, "I don’t think we should be on DreamWorks"—a label that any band would want to be on. It was just funny. But to some degree, maybe that’s part of the reason why they agreed to it as well, because they’re artist-friendly. They know that it was something bigger than an artist being mad at his record label. 

LENNY WARONKER: I know Scott and I don't remember that [meeting]. I do remember that Scott was gonna get involved, which I thought might be nice because I liked him. But I don't remember anything like that.

LUKE WOOD: Elliott was trying to find a place where he could be creative and happy. I think he felt somewhat restricted at a major label: having to do interviews, go on tour, have a commercial record. He didn't like that pressure. I deeply respected him as a musician and a friend. He spent a lot of time at my house. He knew my baby. It was a really difficult period. There's a reason I haven't talked about it for 10 years.







From a Basement on the Hill (2004)

In 2001, Smith begins and ends a series of recording sessions with Jon Brion, which fall apart after Brion confronts him about his drug use and self-destructive behavior. By the fall of that year, he contacts producer David McConnell.


DAVID MCCONNELL [producer; From a Basement on the Hill]: I had XO, which was given to me by a colleague, and I really enjoyed it. Well, half of it was great. Half of it I was like, “Well, great song, but I don’t know if I like the recording or the production." And then my friend Shon Sullivan [from McConnell’s L.A band Goldenboy], was playing with him live, and he invited me out to a show at the Wiltern Theater. I was blown away. It was probably one of the best shows I’ve ever seen in my life. So Shon introduced me to Elliott after the show briefly.

A couple of months after that show, at the end of the Figure 8 tour, he had just started recording with Jon Brion but, for whatever reason, he wasn’t happy with that process, so he split ways with Jon and got in touch with me. When he called me he was actually in Big Bear, up in the mountains, and he was like, “Man, I want to start as soon as possible, can I come down tonight?”

I could tell he was really itching to get into the studio and work with a new producer, someone who was gonna do things a little more experimentally. He wanted somebody who wasn’t so formulaic, who was willing to go down the path of discovery with him, and I guess he heard that maybe I would be that guy.

So I told him we should record in my private studio, because that’s where the more experimental equipment was. I told him he was welcome to stay in the house, too, because we had a guest room. The studio was beautiful; my ex-girlfriend actually owned the property, and it was almost like a compound, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. I had named it Satellite Park one day when I was walking around because it felt like I was on the moon or on an observatory somewhere. 

When he showed up, it was around 2 a.m., and he was in two cars; his girlfriend [Valerie Deerin] was driving one car and he was driving the other car, and both cars were full of all of his belongings. I mean everything from his apartment. I was thinking he was gonna show up with a suitcase and a backpack and a couple of guitars, but it was like five guitars, a giant keyboard, amps, and then five suitcases of clothes. He had toys, books, you name it. And then he had medication, and various other things.

He also brought all his his two-inch reels that he was working on at Jon’s house. So we drank a couple of beers and I gave him the tour of the place and everything, and then he goes, "OK, there’s a song on here that I recorded by myself at Jon’s place that I want to keep, that I really like. Why don’t you just mix this song for me and I’ll be back in the morning.” Then he left. He was like, "I’ve got some errands to run right now, I’ve got some stuff I gotta do.” Remember, this is 2 a.m.—well no, by now it’s 4 a.m., because we had talked about my philosophy on recording and producing for two hours.

So I put the reel on the machine and I started listening to the song, just by myself. And the first time I heard it, just pushing up the faders so I could hear the different instruments and his voice, I got the chills. It was one of the most haunting, beautiful songs I’d ever heard. It sounded nothing like the music I’d heard him do before. It sounded way more intricate, way more complex. 

It reminded me of Rachmaninoff, but with lyrics, with a story. Sitting in there alone, I almost had an out-of-body experience because I knew that I was about to work on one of the best things I’d ever worked on in my life. So I spent the next three or four hours mixing the song, which was called "True Love Is a Rose". It's a shame because that song never ended up on the album. He wanted it to be on the album, it was one of his favorites. 

So he finally got back, listened to my mix, loved it, and then he says, "Let’s start recording another song." At this point he probably hasn’t slept in two days.

The next track we worked on was “Shooting Star”. He told me he wanted it to have this psychedelic intensity, to take elements of Hendrix and the Stooges, but create something that couldn’t be compared to anybody else. We slowed down the reel, just slightly, so it would have a euphoric, heavy, psychedelic persona. 

“Shooting Star” has three drum sets: We would do one drum take, and then we would double the drums, and then sometimes triple them. If you listen closely on headphones, you’ll hear the snare drums flailing, because there are three kits going on. He and I talked about that; I’d say "Hey, you know, this sounds great, are you comfortable with having the snares slightly out of time?" And he was like, "Man, I love it." He wanted to embrace the human quality of this sound, that was very important for him.

He wanted "Shooting Star" to be the opening track then. "Coast To Coast", the opener on the album that got released, was another one we worked on together. He recorded the drum tracks at Sunset Sounds studio with Steven [Drozd], from the Flaming Lips, and the poet Nelson Gary’s part at the end. He had two drummers playing live at the same time on that, he told me, and he stood in the middle of the room pointing at each drummer to do the changes, like he was doing his own version of conducting.

STEVEN DROZD: I went to Los Angeles to visit my then-ex-girlfriend and now wife: We'd been broken up for a few years and she'd gotten into a serious relationship and then got out of the serious relationship and I was trying to win her back. I contacted Elliott, and he said, "I know of this Suboxone doctor that's helped me greatly"—which is this drug you take to get off opiates—"and I'm doing some recording. Could you come down and play some drums?" 

So we just set up the two drum kits and played at the same time. I know that you can be a highly functioning drug addict depending on what drugs you're getting into, but to me, it didn't seem like he was affected at all. He was fucking in charge of the session. People think I played drums all over that record, but it really just ended up being one song.

DAVID MCCONNELL: From that first night, he basically moved in and ended up living there with me for many months. And that’s when we did the bulk of the album. We’d be in my bedroom and he’d sit on the bed and play me songs really late at night. He played "King's Crossing" for me on his guitar one night, although that’s not a song we worked on together.

He brought his guitars, but the funny thing about Elliott is he had five of the same guitar, the Gibson ES-330. I never understood it, exactly. I was like, "OK, that’s great, we can use those, but if you want this bigger guitar sound, I encourage you to check out the guitars that I have." On “Shooting Star”, he fell in love with this old 60s Telecaster I have. Most of the really big guitars you hear on that album are that Telly because this guitar just spits at you. 

He was constantly testing me. He always asked me what my favorite albums were, and it was important that they weren’t ones that were super-produced, because his favorite records weren’t slick; they weren’t perfect. Elliott was very adamant not to use Pro Tools because he didn’t want to fix things. That was one of the important things I learned from working with him on that record: The technically-correct performance isn’t beautiful. It's the performance that can’t be replicated ever again.

One of the things that was really fun and worked well was, if we would double a guitar track, we would purposefully de-tune the guitar. So for the first track, we would make it a little bit sharp, and then for the second, we would make it a little bit flat. If you played one by itself it was kind of upsetting, but when they came together, all of a sudden you’d start smiling.

I’d never see anyone use drugs like Elliott before. I knew I couldn’t give him an intervention, because he’d already warned me. I knew that I couldn’t say, "Hey, you have to leave," because if he wasn’t with me, he’d end up somewhere else which could potentially be harmful. I knew that at my place I could at least watch him.

I think I developed an anxiety disorder working with Elliott. He's one of the most complicated people I’ve ever known in my life. Every once in awhile we’d get in an argument, and he’d leave, and we wouldn’t talk for a week. Then he’d call me and say, "This is stupid, let’s go get a beer and talk." That was how the pattern went. The next day he’d be back at my place. But I loved him like a brother. I wasn’t about to turn my back on him. 

It got the point when he really needed his own place to finish the record, so I helped him put together his New Monkey studio, and then continued to work with him there. That went on for months and months, and then we kind of lost track. That was basically the last year of his life. 

LOU BARLOW: I was seeing him more often around that period, too. He was talking about not doing as many drugs. He had been through a really bad period and the spark was kind of coming back. He was in this really bizarre period where he was dressing like Willie Nelson—he would wear these strange silk pants with embroidery down the side and long, flowing shirts. But then he started to look like Elliott again. 

He was accumulating so much gear at that time, too. He was on eBay constantly, managing a slew of auctions. This was for his studio, New Monkey, that he was building in North Hollywood. This guy who was playing drums in the Folk Implosion was also scheming heavily to be in Elliott's band and hanging around Elliott constantly. Every time he'd hang out with him, he'd come back with a different piece of equipment, like, "Yeah, Elliott handed this to me." "What? That's a $750 contraption for Christ's sake!" All of this stuff of Elliott's started accumulating in my practice space. "Wow! Where did you get that bass?" "Oh, Elliott gave it to me last night." "Really? That's a $2,000 bass." He would just be really high and tell the guy, "Yeah, you should take it." 

AUTUMN DE WILDE: As a photographer, I made a decision not to document that time period. That’s not the kind of artist I am. I don’t judge someone who does that at all, but that was not what I was there for. After that point, I was there as his friend until I wasn’t welcomed as his friend. I know he loved me a lot, and I loved him a lot, but it’s not the same person. Everybody who was a close friend basically had to say goodbye twice.

JJ GONSON: I talked to him on the phone around '99, and he was a mess. I hadn't spoken with him in a very long time, because I had to say, "I can't be in touch with you anymore." The last thing he said to me was, "I'll write you a letter." Which of course he didn't do.

He burned every bridge that he crossed. He didn't just say, "Look, I need a break." He took a machete, chopped you into tiny little pieces, poured battery acid on it, then added salt and set you on fire. He did this painful, painful ripping himself away from people thing to protect himself. He genuinely believed, I think, that he was doing the right thing for other people. He had convinced himself that the world was better off not having him in it, for other people.


On October 21, 2003, Smith dies in an L.A. hospital at age 34 after suffering two stab wounds to the chest.


ROB SCHNAPF: He had been calling me the week before [his death], and was like, "Hey, I want to play you what I have for my record." I didn’t call him back. I didn’t know if I felt like dealing with it.

When our son was born in 1999, we got a phone call in the hospital room around midnight. It was Elliott. He was like, "Hey, would it be OK to come and hang out?" So he came down and he was there all night. We wandered the hospital, just hanging out. It was really cool that he wanted to come share that special time with us. Sonny was born at eight in the morning; four years later, Elliott dies on [Sonny's] birthday. We were coming back from taking Sonny to see some big IMAX rocketship thing, and I get a phone call from Luke Wood saying, "Hey, have you heard any rumors?" I was like, "No, why?" He said, "I just heard one that wasn’t good."

MARGARET MITTLEMAN: I remember Sonny bopping around the backyard in his spacesuit. We were just having a family day. It was so bizarre because I had felt so removed. Somebody called Rob. I didn’t get the call. That made me feel even worse. 

ROB SCHNAPF: It was absolutely devastating. It’s one of those things: You know one day your parents are going to die, and then they die, and it’s still devastating, no matter how much you’re prepared for it. A lot of people said, "Well, you must’ve not been surprised." But I was still fucking surprised.

AUTUMN DE WILDE: He died on my birthday, which has nothing to do with me except it happened to be my birthday. Then every birthday that follows, there’s a period of mourning and a little sadness and I’m thinking, "Am I being really dramatic?" Part of what helps is imagining him laughing at me and just being like, "C’mon, dude. This isn’t a movie about your life where the perfect, crazy dramatic ending is on your birthday."

STEVEN DROZD: We were in Seattle playing the last show of a tour opening for the Chili Peppers, and a very small percentage of the crowd cared about seeing us. We found out that night. It was just awful. I'm gonna start crying just thinking about it now. It was just so brutal. It fucked me up because I went to a bar in Seattle to try to escape, and then everyone in the bar is talking about it. People were visibly upset, crying. It was crazy.

DAVID MCCONNELL: I wasn’t involved in the completion of [From a Basement on the Hill], which was interesting, because Elliott and I had already mixed several songs for the album that were done. After his death, the family took over and brought in some really talented folks, but they hadn’t been around for the process, so they didn’t really know the plans he had for the record. I thought it was odd. I don’t blame them, but I think they probably felt uncomfortable including me in the process because they equated me with that part of his life when he was using and not at his best. Maybe they thought that I was one of the bad guys. I really don’t know, I can’t speak for them. But it was unfortunate because there are many things that are different than what he wanted and planned for on that record.

Here’s something I thought would have been groundbreaking: Two songs—"A Passing Feeling” and “Shooting Star”—were gonna be mixed in mono all the way up until a certain point where they’d break into stereo. We mixed those two songs that way, and there were moments when we cried listening to them. The impact was so profound. Anyway, the family never found those mixes for whatever reason. Also, the fact that it’s missing two of the best songs is too bad. One of them is “True Love Is a Rose” and the other one was called “True Friends / See You in Heaven.” It’s not that I’m bitter about that stuff, I just think the record would have been even more impactful. But I wasn’t going to stick my nose in the family’s business. They had just lost their son and they were grieving. It wasn’t my place to do that.

ROB SCHNAPF: Dave [McConnell] was kind of an asshole. I always tried to be really straight with him. Elliott stopped working with him—I don't know why—and he just felt like he knew exactly what Elliott wanted. Then he talked shit about me in the press without ever talking to me.

Elliott’s sister [Ashley] had all the information and she had been talking to Elliott a lot. She felt like she had a good understanding of where he was going. There was one song, "Abused", that the family didn’t want on the album. Then there was another song called “Suicide Machines” that I thought was just asking for trouble if we included it. We just went through what was completed and worked off a sort of projected track order that Elliott had. There was stuff that wasn’t finished, too. I don’t even remember the names of the songs. I’d heard rumors about all this other material, but we never found it. I never heard it.

I had not worked on a friend’s record who had died before. It was weird to hear him be very alive on those tracks. You would hear him go, “Let’s do this.” You’d hear him take a drag, inhale, blow out. You’d hear the piano stool creak, and you'd think, "He’s alive." It was weird because, with all that stuff, you wouldn’t normally think about it, like how you don’t notice the hum of the refrigerator until the house is absolutely silent and it’s three in the morning. 

I was hoping for it to be a cathartic release, knowing at the same time it was never going to be how he planned it, because he wasn’t there. All you could do was try; it was better than silence. It was positive and exciting on one hand, but the thing that bothered me was reading criticism about it that was unfounded. What were the options? Would you prefer to never hear the record? 

People were saying of that album, “Oh, I like this version better, I liked the early versions better.” What? There was nothing different. We didn’t do anything. I didn’t record anything. I took what was there and mixed it. So all those things that are unresolved are to be that way. Unresolved.

It’s a cool, beautiful record. He wrote it when he was alive. He didn’t write it when he was dead, he didn’t write it after a suicide, or after a murder, or whatever the fuck happened. When he was writing it, he still wanted to live his life.

DORIEN GARRY: There was a space and a time after he died when I almost forced myself to listen to him a lot at home, alone, trying to process. It was a little bit cathartic. But now it’s the opposite. I can’t even listen to it. I’ve been at a coffee shop a couple of times when it's come on and it’s a hard few minutes to get through. I hope that changes. I trust that it will. I think I’ll go through another wave of grief where I can listen to him and not feel like I miss him.

ROB SCHNAPF: There was a lot of crassness and a lot of disappointing behavior from people who were supposedly his friends. But the interesting thing is: This is how history is written. The ones who were there aren’t always the ones who speak. But if people are going to go back and use this as a reference, then it should be truthful.

He would have had a great career. He would be on his own right now. He’d be like Wilco, he’d be able to do whatever he wants. He wouldn’t need the business. He wouldn’t need it at all.

I don’t really listen to the records. Elliott still makes me sad, to be perfectly honest. I enjoy it in little bits, but I end up in this particular place, so.

JJ GONSON: When I decided I needed to shut off, I really shut him off. I never heard From the Bottom of the Hill, whatever it's called. I don't know his new songs. I really don't even listen to the old stuff.

LOU BARLOW:  There was an ATP show at the Queen Mary that he was meant to play, like less than three weeks after he died and his girlfriend [Jennifer Chiba] was like, "We're gonna have a show anyway. It's gonna be a tribute.” She approached me, like, "I want you to sing, because Elliott would've wanted you to sing." So I sang with his band and we did the set that he was meant to do. It was weird. I assumed I was terrible, because no one ever said anything about it, or maybe everybody was just freaked out. It was such a strange time.

AUTUMN DE WILDE: A bunch of us were tricked by journalists at the beginning, that’s why everyone’s pretty prickly about it. That was like an incredible breach of trust, and there was a great silence for a long time, from all of us.

But the loss of any friend takes a long time to heal. And then when you’re sharing that friend with people who didn’t know him—which is totally fine and amazing, because I would like everyone to know who he was, and I wish they could have sat with him—it's even weirder. When you tell people that you feel really sad about your grandma dying, they go, "Oh shit, I’m sorry." But when it’s someone famous, often you don’t say it, because immediately you worry: Does it seem like I’m name-dropping? So on top of trying to heal from losing a friend, you’re trying to manage all the bullshit in your head: What are my reasons for bringing this up right now? Is it to say that I knew him? Am I now that person crying in public so that they can say they knew him? Like, what the fuck?

LUKE WOOD: I have not spoken about Elliott since his death. I spoke to many people the week he passed, but that was about trying to express how gifted he was, trying to articulate my thoughts of him as an artist. I thought it was so important that what people remembered about Elliott was his work and not his death. My catharsis was on my own time.







New Moon (2007)

In 2007, Kill Rock Stars releases the rarities and B-sides compilation New Moon; overseen by Larry Crane, the album features liner notes by, among others, Sean Croghan and Rebecca Gates.


LARRY CRANE: Sam [Coomes] doesn't want to go on the record. Sean [Croghan] and I have been available, but we've been burnt by asshole journalists. With New Moon, I had to make a call that I was going to be available, because it was going to be of value. Maggie Vail dropped me a line when she was working at Kill Rock Stars. I knew that [Elliott’s father] Gary Smith was trying to get ahold of me. Initially, New Moon was going to be a bonus version of Either/Or, like an extra disc from that same era. But they decided that that was not necessary. 

I called Gary, and we talked about the latest idea, which was a larger, more comprehensive B-sides and rarities compilation. We discussed what it involved, and I wrote up a little proposal of how much it would cost, what I was going to do. I knew I had to go to L.A. and dig through the vaults where the tapes were stored and do some research. This really opened up the question of, "Shouldn't somebody archive this? We don't know what's on any of these reels until you hear them." And he said, "Would you like to do it?" I didn't expect that to be his response, but I thought, "Well gosh, I guess I could do that."

Luckily, I was able to contact Rob Schnapf, Tony Lash, Neil Gust, even Jon Brion, and all these different people and ask questions, which made a big difference. Initially, it was New Moon and then the archive job, but I wish I could have done it in the opposite order—I wish I could have done as much archiving I could do, and then pull New Moon out of what I found. It wouldn't be that different, but we have better tape transfers now. It would have sounded a little better. And maybe there were a few more songs that could've made it. But that's OK. It's a good record.

I used to go on that horrible Sweet Adeline [fan] forum when New Moon came out, and someone was mad that I put the drum tracking on a song. People had strong feelings because they heard rough mixes of these songs for years on cassette, where things were playing at the wrong speed, and they were giving me heat for offering the right version. [laughs] I just had to approach like, "I'm going to try to mix these similar to how he mixed the record." I wasn't trying to make judgments about if the song was really good or really bad, because they all seem pretty good to me.

AUTUMN DE WILDE: My relationship with that Figure 8 wall now is conflicted. Not because I have any grievances about it, but it was my wall that nobody cared about, you know? But I’m so glad because I love the Serge Gainsbourg wall—I don’t have any painful memories attached to the Serge Gainsbourg wall. So I tend to not get too close or read anything on it. It’s so awesome that people are repainting it, but it’s burned in my head—this mural from childhood—so I can't help but think that they painted it wrong. I don’t mean to sound like an asshole. I just mean they didn’t reproduce it exactly the same, so for me it’s like a weird blip, an awkward thing to look at because my eyes are trying to correct it.

LUKE WOOD: I've been fortunate to work with a lot of great artists in my career, but as a composer and a performer, Elliott was profoundly unique. The way he used harmonic structures. He could sit down to the piano and play Rachmaninoff. He could play almost any instrument. He could go from bluegrass to folk. He would go, literally, from Chopin to picking up the guitar and playing a Minutemen riff. When you have someone that's that deeply gifted and special, you're really just lucky to be in the room.

SCOTT BOOKER: I always said Either/Or is one of my top 10 albums of all time. The sad thing is I can’t listen to it anymore, it’s too hard. I'll put it on and my mind just starts thinking of things that I don’t want to think about while listening to a record I love. 

TONY LASH: For better or worse, there's a certain amount of locking Elliott away as I knew him.  There are obviously a lot of reasons to be sad about him passing, but one of the things that I found most sad was that the there was a lot of deterioration that happened. For the most part, people always have the capacity to change for the better. He had become distant from my life, and our relationship had fallen by the wayside, but I always felt like he was probably the single most talented musician that I ever worked with. Once we repaired our friendship, I thought there was always the potential we could do something again some day. When he died, that possibility was taken away, along with the possibility that he could find those really wonderful parts about himself again.

JJ GONSON: I didn't talk to anybody for like eight years. I couldn't do it. I just couldn't deal. The edge needed to wear off a little bit, because it was so raw. Elliott and I have mutual friends who talked a lot, right at the beginning. Now they're like, "I'm done, I never want to hear his name again." It's interesting. Recently, it's been kind of nice: People want to know, and I appreciate that as a music lover. Elliott was fantastic. He was a hilariously funny, super-fun person to be with, someone I absolutely adored with every microfiber of my body. It will always be a hard process, but I do feel some reconciliation in other people coming together.

Marissa Mayer cover with byline

On the morning of Thursday, July 12, 2012, Yahoo’s interim CEO, Ross Levinsohn, still believed he was going to be named permanent CEO of the company.

He had just one meeting to go.

That meeting was a board meeting, to be held that day in a room on the second floor of Yahoo’s Sunnyvale, Calif., headquarters. The room was big, with a large horseshoe table and video screens on the walls.

The agenda for the meeting: Levinsohn was going to brief the directors on his plan for Yahoo, should he be named permanent CEO.

Levinsohn walked into the room; all of his top executives followed.

There was Jim Heckman, Levinsohn’s top dealmaker, who’d spent months negotiating a huge deal with Microsoft. There was Shashi Seth, Yahoo’s top product management executive, already planning a long-needed update to Yahoo Mail and the Yahoo home page. There was chief financial officer Tim Morse, who’d just completed a critical, company-saving deal to sell a portion of Yahoo subsidiary Alibaba. There was Mickie Rosen, a News Corp. veteran whom Levinsohn had hired to run Yahoo’s media business. And there was Mollie Spillman, whom he’d just made CMO.

Heckman, Seth, Morse, Rosen, Spillman, and handful of others sat off to the side.

All of them believed that the meeting was a formality — that Levinsohn was going to get the job.

They had good reason to be confident. For the two months prior, the chairman of Yahoo’s board, Fred Amoroso, had made it clear that he was going to do everything he could to make sure Levinsohn and his team would be running the company for the foreseeable future.

Amoroso told Levinsohn this in private. He told Yahoo employees this during an all-hands meeting in May. He’d even joined a sales call to express support for Levinsohn to Yahoo advertisers — an oddly hands-on move for a chairman.

In June, Amoroso helped Levinsohn recruit a high-profile Google executive named Michael Barrett into Yahoo. During the recruiting process, Amoroso promised Barrett that Levinsohn’s “interim” title was only temporary — that it was safe to leave Google.

Levinsohn had another reason to be hopeful: For the past few months, he’d been speaking with two of Yahoo’s most important new directors, Dan Loeb and Michael Wolf, almost every day. As important as it was for Levinsohn to have Amoroso’s support, he needed Loeb’s more. Loeb ran a hedge fund called Third Point, which owned more than 5 percent of Yahoo and had, only months before, forced the resignation of Yahoo’s previous CEO. Wolf was an important ally for Levinsohn to have, too. Wolf, a former president of MTV, was consulting for Third Point on media investments when Loeb asked him to join the Yahoo board and lead its search committee for a new CEO.

Levinsohn began his presentation. It was going to be a doozy, as he planned to seriously alter the direction of Yahoo.

He wanted it to stop competing with technology businesses like Google and Microsoft and focus entirely on competing with media and content businesses like Disney, Time Warner, and News Corporation. As part of this transition, Levinsohn wanted to spin off, sell, or shut down several Yahoo business units. He said doing so would reduce Yahoo’s head count by as many as 10,000 employees, and increase its earnings before taxes and interest by as much as 50 percent.

In fact, Levinsohn announced during his presentation that he and his team had already started down this road.

Levinsohn told the board that, under his direction, Heckman had begun negotiating a deal with Microsoft to exchange Yahoo’s search business for Microsoft’s portal, MSN.com, and large payments in cash. Levinsohn and Heckman had also been talking with Google executive Henrique De Castro about turning over some of Yahoo’s advertising inventory. There was also talk of unloading some of Yahoo’s enterprise-facing advertising-technology businesses into a joint venture involving New York-based ad tech startup AppNexus.

Dan Loeb controlled 5 percent of Yahoo and joined the board after a bloody proxy fight.



It was during this part of his presentation that Levinsohn began to feel the permanent Yahoo CEO job slipping away.

Others in the room got the same sinking feeling.

Wolf, the man in charge of the committee tasked with hiring a permanent CEO, began to question the wisdom of the deal.

Wolf asked, in a loud voice with a sharp tone, “I understand why this is good for Microsoft, but why is it good for Yahoo?”

Harry Wilson, another director brought onto the board by Loeb, joined Wolf in his criticism of the deal as “short-sighted.”

Their cross-examination of the deal eventually boiled down to one question: Had Levinsohn and Heckman made any irreversible commitments to either Microsoft or Google?

It was obvious to several people in the room that Wolf and Wilson wanted to make sure another candidate for the CEO job would not be forced to follow through on a deal they had not negotiated.

This was a bad sign for Levinsohn’s candidacy.

But Wilson and Wolf’s loud complaints about the Microsoft deal weren’t the worst sign for Levinsohn’s chances; Loeb’s behavior during the meeting was.

Loeb is the suited, slick, and handsome Wall Street type. He wears his salt-and-pepper hair short and messy on purpose. He’s actually from Southern California, and sometimes he puts off a surfer vibe.

During Levinsohn’s presentation, Loeb looked bored. He wasn’t paying full attention. As the interim CEO talked, Loeb stood at the back of the room and played with his BlackBerry.

One person in the room remembers watching Loeb texting for a while and then, “during the most important part of the presentation,” getting up and going to the bathroom for 10 minutes.

This person remembers thinking: “Oh, OK. Sorry, Ross, you’re not CEO anymore.”

After the meeting, Barrett, the Google executive Amoroso had helped Levinsohn poach, called Levinsohn to ask how it went. Levinsohn told him he no longer felt like he was getting the job.

But who was?

That night, Levinsohn flew to Sun Valley, Idaho, where investment bank Allen & Co. holds an annual retreat for big-name media and technology executives.

Over the weekend, Levinsohn played a guessing game with venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Square CEO Jack Dorsey, and Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. With each of them, Levinsohn and the other Silicon Valley bigwigs ran through a long list of names, trying to figure out who might be getting the job Levinsohn had so hoped for. For each name they came up with, they came up with a persuasive reason why that person could not be it.

Whom had Wolf and Loeb so clearly already decided on?

Finally, late Sunday night, Levinsohn got a call from a friend of his at Google.

This person asked: Had Levinsohn heard that Marissa Mayer had interviewed for the Yahoo job the Wednesday prior?

Levinsohn realized everything all at once.

Levinsohn now knew who Yahoo’s next CEO would be.

Soon, so would everyone else.

On Monday, July 16, four days after Levinsohn’s last board meeting, Yahoo made it official: Thirty-seven-year-old Marissa Mayer was Yahoo’s new CEO.

The board had indeed already made Mayer an offer by the time Levinsohn went into that final meeting to present his plan for Yahoo.

After the news broke in public, Levinsohn admitted to friends that he was disappointed. He had really wanted the job, and believed he would have done very well with it. He also felt bad for the team he put in place, who would now have to report to an unfamiliar leader.

But Levinsohn was also at peace. If he had to lose out to someone, at least he lost out to an icon.

Marissa Mayer



There is no one else in the world like Marissa Mayer.

Now 38 years old, she is a wife, a mother, an engineer, and the CEO of a 30-billion-dollar company. She is a woman in an industry dominated by men. In a world where corporations are expected to serve shareholders before anyone else, she is obsessed with putting the customer experience first.

Worth at least $300 million, she isn’t afraid to show off her wealth. Steve Jobs may have lived in a small, suburban home with an apple tree out front, but Marissa Mayer lives in the penthouse of San Francisco’s Four Seasons Hotel.

While rival CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page of Google wear flip-flops, hoodies, and T-shirts, Mayer wears Oscar de la Renta on the red carpet.

Mayer calls herself a geek, but she doesn’t look the part. With her blonde hair, blue eyes, and glamorous style, she has Hollywood-actress good looks.

Young, powerful, rich, and brilliant, Mayer is a role model for millions of women. And yet, unlike Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, Mayer resists calling herself a feminist. She even infuriated working mothers across the world when she banned Yahoo employees from working from home.

Widely admired by the public at large, Mayer has many enemies within her industry. They say she is robotic, stuck up, and absurd in her obsession with detail. They say her obsession with the user experience masks a disdain for the money-making side of the technology industry.

There is some truth to what they say.

And yet, a year after Mayer took over Yahoo, the company’s stock price was up 100 percent. Engineers wanted to work for Yahoo again. More importantly, so did sought-after startup CEOs like Tumblr founder David Karp, who agreed to sell his company to Yahoo for $1.1 billion.

Questions persist

Most CEOs of Mayer’s stature — people running multibillion-dollar public companies the size of Yahoo — are gregarious, outgoing types — the kind of person who might have been a politician if the world of business and money hadn’t beckoned. Baby-kissers. Back-slappers. Schmoozers. Mayer is not that type. Peers from every stage of her life — from her early childhood days to her first year at Yahoo — say Mayer is a shy, socially awkward person.

How in the world has she overcome such a disadvantage to rise so far, so fast?

To a public casually interested in her career, Mayer’s career before Yahoo — spent entirely at Google — is remembered as one success after another. It wasn’t.

Mayer started off at Google spectacularly well, designing its home page, creating its product management structure, and becoming the face of the company. She became one of the most powerful people at one of the world’s most powerful companies.

But then, suddenly, her peers were promoted past her. Responsibility for the look and feel of Google’s entire suite of consumer-facing products, including the Google home page, was taken away from her. She was moved to a less important product: Google Maps. She was removed from a council of executives that met with Google’s CEO. To industry insiders, this sudden change was a demotion for Mayer. Was it actually? If it was, why did it happen? How did Mayer recover?

Mayer’s move to the top of Yahoo during the summer of 2012 was a shock for almost everyone — including the people who convinced her to do it. How did the board pull it off?

Then there’s the biggest question about Mayer: Can she save Yahoo?



Part 1_03 (1)

Marissa Ann Mayer was born May 30, 1975 to parents Margaret Mayer, a Finnish art teacher and homemaker, and Michael Mayer, an environmental engineer.

She grew up in Wausau, Wis., with a sports-playing brother, Mason Mayer. It was a middle-class upbringing. She went to public schools and worked a summer job as a grocery clerk, but her family had enough time and money to enroll her in countless activities.

Most press photos of Mayer today show her on a stage, speaking with an interviewer in front of a large crowd or a TV audience. She’s usually wearing a designer dress — probably from her favorite designer, Oscar de la Renta — and looking strong, confident, and in charge of the moment.

But Mayer, now 38 years old, wasn’t always so larger-than-life. She describes the child and teenage version of herself as “painfully shy.”

Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer at the 2013 Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference.

Indeed, the Mayer you see in photos today is not the one remembered by the peers she grew up with in the small town of Wausau. For one, her style involved more T-shirts, sweaters, and jeans — nice clothes, but nothing flashy. And while Mayer has always presented well in front of an audience, her peers don’t remember her as extroverted or larger-than-life.

One of those peers is named Brian Jojade. He took Advanced Math with Mayer in eighth grade. He remembers Mayer as someone who hated social attention. Once, Jojade called the local radio station and told them it was Mayer’s birthday. He asked the DJ to read her name out on air. Jojade, who had a small crush on Mayer, figured hearing her name would make her laugh. It didn’t. “She wasn’t amused at all. You could just tell it wasn’t fun for her.”

Otherwise, Jojade’s overriding memory of Mayer is as the “professional” girl who sat in the front of the classroom and “always worked hard and made sure no matter what she was going to do, it was going to get done right.”

Mayer’s Wausau West High School classmate Elize Bazter says she best remembers Mayer as the girl who was “kind to everyone” but would dodge conversations on her way to go study somewhere else.

Wausau West had a class schedule system where, instead of periods, the day was broken up into 20-minute “mods.” Classes lasted for 40 minutes or an hour. That meant there were 20-minute breaks during everyone’s day. Bazter said most upperclassmen would use the time to congregate in the school’s commons.

“You could study,” says Bazter, “but mostly it was talking and eating and gathering with your friends.”

Not for teenage Marissa Mayer.

“She would be the person to come down, get something to eat from the kitchen or the vending machines, and then she would go to the library or the science lab to study. She wouldn’t be the one to stay and sit there and converse for 20 minutes.”

Bazter says the image she thinks of when she remembers Mayer is of her “in school, books in hand, walking down the hallway to do something else.”

None of this is to say that Mayer had a sad, lonely time growing up in Wausau. She didn’t. Mayer is fond of Wausau.

When she got married to a San Francisco banker named Zachary Bogue in 2009, she held two ceremonies: One was in California, and a second at her childhood church, Immanuel Lutheran in Wausau.

As a kid, Mayer’s peers in school had no idea what to make of her. Likewise, Mayer says she was “painfully shy” around them. But teachers? Teachers were Mayer’s kind of people.

In 2010, Mayer returned to her hometown to be inducted into the Wausau School District’s “Alumni Hall of Fame.” At a luncheon held in honor of her and 25 teachers retiring that year, Mayer gave a speech that the school district recorded in a video.

In the video, Mayer stands at a podium in a blue designer dress with a yellow corsage pinned on. She begins the speech by thanking her teachers, “each of whom changed my life forever.”

Then she begins to list her teachers by name. As she does — “… Mr. Freedly, Mrs. Stay, Mr. Flanagan …” — you can see on Mayer’s face how important these people were to her growing up. About six names in, the timbre of Mayer’s voice actually breaks toward a sob, and she has to catch herself with a breath and a small gulp. She can’t stop her eyes from swelling with held-back tears, though.

Most teenagers fondly recall sneaking into high school their senior year for a prank — setting chickens loose or toilet-papering the hallways. Mayer once snuck into her AP Lit teacher’s classroom to decorate it like a jungle because she was so inspired by the teacher’s lesson on “Heart of Darkness.”

Mayer’s fifth-grade teacher at Stettin Elementary, Wayne Flanagan, remembers that Mayer refused to leave his classroom the last day of that school year. She did not want to go to middle school.

She told Flanagan she was worried that she wouldn’t make it there, with all the new kids and teachers she’d have to meet.

Flanagan says Mayer the little girl was “a home person; she liked to be safe and know where she’s at.”

Flanagan, who says it was obvious even then how far Mayer would go, told the reluctant little girl, “Oh, I think you’re going to make it fine.”

Still, she wouldn’t go. Eventually Flanagan called Mayer’s mother to let her know where her daughter was.

Certainly the people Mayer spent most of her childhood with were a particular kind of nurturing, mentoring adult: coaches, teachers, counselors, and instructors.

As a little kid, she was in Brownies. She took piano lessons. She played volleyball and basketball. She went to swimming and skiing lessons. She took ballet for as many as 35 hours a week during middle school and high school. Her mother says ballet taught her “criticism and discipline, poise and confidence.”

She was a “pompom” girl and a debater. She was on the precision dance team. A middle school classmate of Mayer's says she was on her high school curling team. (After this story was published, Mayer said she wasn't.)

Mayer was so busy in part because her mother, Margaret Mayer, pushed her to be.

Flanagan, the fifth-grade teacher, says Mayer’s mother would frequently stop by school to check on her daughter’s progress. He says he “got to be good friends” with the Mayers. “They were concerned about her and that she was making the right progress. And she was. And she knew that — that her parents were supportive of her.”

In one way, Mayer owes her career to the relationships she was able to form with teachers.

Statistics show that many high school girls do not feel like they belong in math or science classes. In 2003, 84 percent of high schoolers who took the SAT and said they wanted to major in computer science were boys — obviously that means just 16 percent were women.

Wausau West High School Yearbook

Mayer was on Wausau West's state championship winning debate team.

Mayer says she never felt that bias at Wausau West.

“It wasn’t until I was a professional woman mentoring other girls in math and science that I learned that openly liking math and science is unusual for girls. It’s actually considered far too nerdy and far too much for the boys.

“Wausau schools were so supportive that I never felt strange for a second about pursuing math and science and being good in them.”

Mayer credits her teachers for helping her become less shy.

They did this by showing Mayer that she could “organize” more than just her backpack, desk, and homework — that she could organize people, as their leader.

Mayer’s childhood piano teacher, Joanne Beckman, remembers Mayer being very different from other children in that she was someone who “watched people” in order to “figure out why they were doing what they were doing.”

“A lot of kids that age are very interested in themselves,” Beckman says, “She was looking at other people.”

By “looking” at her teachers, figuring out why they were doing what they were doing, Mayer overcame her “painful” shyness with peers by taking on the teacher’s role.

Even when she was in fifth grade, Mr. Flanagan could see the pedagogical side of Mayer developing. He thought she would become a teacher someday.

In high school, Mayer took a leadership position in every club she joined. She became president of the Spanish club, treasurer of Key Club, and captain of the debate team.

One of her closest friends from Wausau, Abigail Garvey Wilson, says, “When Marissa became captain of the pompom squad, she wasn’t in with that clique of girls, but she won them over in three ways.”

“First: sheer talent. Marissa could choreograph a great routine. Second: hard work. She scheduled practices lasting hours to make sure everyone was synchronized. And third: fairness. With Marissa in charge, the best dancers made the team.”

In 1993, Mayer applied to, and was accepted into, 10 schools, including Harvard, Yale, Duke, and Northwestern.

To decide which one she would go to, Mayer created a spreadsheet, weighing variables for each.

She picked Stanford. Her plan was to become a brain doctor — a profession that doesn’t draw much on the leadership traits Mayer was quickly developing.

But soon enough, Mayer would find herself once again overcoming her shyness by taking charge of a room full of peers, pushing them to work for hours.

Soon enough, she would find herself at the front of a Stanford classroom, interacting with people in the way that came most natural to her — teaching them.

Teaching was her calling.

The summer before Marissa Mayer went to Stanford, she began asking herself a question that would guide her through college and for the rest of her life.

What does Zune think?

That summer, Mayer attended the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia. It was nerd heaven. Picture science labs housed in wooden cabins shaded by trees. Mayer especially loved one experiment where they mixed water and cornstarch to make a sloppy goo-like substance that seemed to defy gravity.

One day, a postdoctoral student from Yale named Zune Nguyen spoke to the campers as a guest lecturer. He stunned all the smart kids in the room with puzzles and brainteasers. For days, the campers couldn’t stop talking about his talk.

Finally, one of Mayer’s counselors had enough.

“You know, you have it all wrong,” the counselor said to Mayer and the campers. “It’s not what Zune knows, it’s how Zune thinks.”

The counselor said that what made Nguyen so amazing wasn’t the facts that he knew, but rather how he approached the world and how he thought about problems. The counselor said the most remarkable thing about Nguyen was that you could put him in an entirely new environment or present him with an entirely new problem, and within a matter of minutes he would be asking the right questions and making the right observations.

From that moment on, the phrase: “It’s not what Zune knows, but how Zune thinks,” stuck with Mayer as a sort of personal guiding proverb.

In the fall, Mayer went to Stanford and began taking pre-med classes. She planned to become a doctor. But by the end of her freshman year, she was sick of it.

“I was just doing too many flashcards,” she says. “They were easy for me, but it was just a lot of memorization.”

She says she wanted to find a major “that really made me think” — that would train her to “think critically, and become a great problem-solver.” She also wanted to “study how people think, how they reason, how they express themselves.”

“I had this nagging voice in my head saying ‘It’s not what Zune knows, but how Zune thinks.’”

Mayer began to answer the voice in her head — and find a course of study that helped her learn how to think — when she took an introductory computer science class: CS105.

Mayer was engrossed by the challenge of programming — taking a problem and using her mind to solve it.

During the semester, she entered a classwide design contest for extra credit. Calling on the same part of her brain that made her such an excellent pompom choreographer, Mayer made a screen saver featuring exploding fireworks. In a class of 300, Mayer came in second.

The design was good enough that Mayer’s CS105 professor, Eric Roberts, would also use an adaptation of the screen saver as an assignment for the next several years.

Stanford professor Eric Roberts says Mayer was an incredible teacher.

Roberts was also impressed enough with Mayer’s exploding fireworks that he invited her and a few other top finishers over for dinner at his house. He became her mentor, as once again, Mayer bonded with a teacher.

Mayer had also found her major.

Mayer opted for symbolic systems — a combination of disciplines straight out of Zune Nguyen’s head: Linguistics, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and computer science classes.

Symbolic systems has become a famous Stanford major in Silicon Valley. Besides Mayer, other alumni include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman; former senior vice president of iOS software at Apple, Scott Forstall; and Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger.

Mayer’s teacherly leadership streak came out in a big way when she took Philosophy 160A, then considered a “weed-out course” for prospective symbolic systems majors.

During Philosophy 160A, the students break into study groups of a half dozen or so students, and the groups are assigned problem sets. Mayer’s group — just like all the others — put off doing their problem sets until the day before they were due.

So that semester at Stanford was full of all-nighters for Mayer and her Philosophy 160A group.

Mayer ended up in a group that included Josh Elman, now a venture capitalist. Looking back on those study sessions, Elman remembers “times when people in the group were bouncing off the walls.”

He says, “Marissa was always like, ‘OK, back to work. Let’s get this done.’ She was focused on making sure we got the right answer quickly.”

“It felt like she was the smartest student in the room — and the most serious. You always knew those two things about her. Very smart. Very serious.”

The social dynamic of the group was typical for Mayer. As usual, she commanded the room — organized the group’s work in an all-business fashion — but was otherwise shy, and somewhat reclusive.

In the years ahead, this combination — Mayer’s willingness to be authoritative and demanding the way a teacher would, with a “painful” fear or reluctance of being personal — would cause problems for Mayer.

One Stanford classmate interpreted Mayer’s shyness as being “kind of stuck up.”

“She would do her work and then leave. When other people would stay and hang out and have pizza, she’d just be out of there because the work is done.”

Indeed, Mayer doesn’t seem to have had a very active social life in college.

One person who lived in her dorm said she appeared to always be “down to business” and “not much for socializing.”

“She wasn’t one of those people into making new friends around the dorm. She was always doing something more important than just chilling.”

The simplest explanation for Mayer’s social behavior at Stanford remains that Mayer was, as she has said many times, “painfully shy.”

Later at Stanford, Mayer found herself in a group setting that was less social, more comfortable, and more familiar for her. As an upperclassman in symbolic systems, she was tapped to teach a class.

She took to it naturally.

Computer science professor Eric Roberts, still Mayer’s mentor, supervised her teaching. He says she was “unusually good at it” and “extremely effective.”

After Mayer taught a course in the spring, Roberts took a survey of her students. The results were astounding: They loved her — even if she did sometimes talk “a mile a minute.”

Roberts asked Mayer to stick around Stanford to teach another class over the summer; she readily agreed.

“She loved teaching,” says Roberts.

Of course she did. Stanford students called her “stuck up” when they were her classmates. But when she was their teacher, they thought she was great.

Mayer excelled the rest of her years as an undergraduate at Stanford. After she got her bachelor’s degree, she stayed at the school to get a master’s in computer science, with a speciality in artificial intelligence.

As graduate school drew to a close, word got out about Mayer’s teaching ability.

She soon faced a choice.

Should she become a teacher, and step full time into a role that had always suited her so well?

Or should she challenge herself and work somewhere in the technology industry?

Taking A 2 percent Chance On Google

When people ask Mayer why she joined Google after getting her masters in symbolic systems at Stanford, she likes to tell them her “Laura Beckman story.” It’s about the daughter of her middle school piano teacher, Joanne Beckman.

Mayer begins: “Laura tried out for the volleyball team her junior year at high school. At the end of the tryouts, she was given a hard choice: bench on varsity, or start on JV.

“Most people, when they’re faced with this choice, would choose to play - and they'll pick JV. Laura did the opposite. She chose varsity, and she benched the whole season.

“But then an amazing thing happened. Senior year she tried out and she made varsity as a starter, and all the JV starters from the previous year benched their whole senior year.

“I remember asking her: ‘How did you know to choose varsity?’

“And she said, ‘I just knew that if I got to practice with the better players every day, I would become a much better player, even if I didn’t get to play in any of the games.’”

The moral of Mayer’s story is that it’s always better to surround yourself with the best people so that they will challenge you and you will grow.

“My quest to find, and be surrounded by, smart people is what brought me to Google,” she says.

And that’s the overriding reason why Mayer joined Google. But quests for self-improvement aside, it’s also true that Mayer almost missed her chance to join the company that would make her rich and powerful someday.

Late on a Friday in mid-April of her last year at Stanford, Mayer sat at her computer, eating pasta and reading emails.

She already had 12 job offers to choose from, and wasn’t looking for any more hard choices.

So when yet another pitch from a recruiter popped up in her inbox, she tapped on her keyboard’s delete key to get rid of it.

Only, she missed.

Instead of hitting delete, Mayer hit the space bar and opened the email.

That email’s subject line: “Work at Google?”

Mayer read the email and remembered a conversation she had with Eric Roberts who was still a mentor years after she took his computer science class for non-majors. The prior fall, Roberts listened to Mayer talk about the recommendation engine she’d built, and then told her she should meet with a pair of Ph.D. students who were working on similar stuff. Their names: Sergey Brin and Larry Page.

Mayer realized that Google was their startup. Trusting Roberts' recommendation, she replied to an email she had meant to delete, writing that she’d like an interview.

She got one, and met with engineer Craig Silverstein. Silverstein blew her away with his smarts. In the Laura Beckman analogy, he was varsity.

Google offered Mayer a job. She seriously considered it.

Her reservations were that she had planned on taking a job at consulting firm McKinsey, where her clients would be Silicon Valley companies.

Google was a riskier career choice. In her typical, precise way, she’d crunched the data and had decided that the company only had a 2 percent chance of succeeding.

Also, some small part of Mayer was worried about Google’s weird name, which she imagined would be the punch line of family jokes for years to come.

She got over it.

“The turning point for me,” she says, “was realizing that I would learn more at Google, trying to build a company, regardless of whether we failed or succeeded, than I would at any of the other companies I had offers from.”

For the next 13 years, Marissa Mayer worked at Google.

Marissa Mayer joined Google as a programmer and rose to become the executive in charge of the way Google search and many other popular Google products looked to Web users.

She became a senior vice president, with thousands of Google employees reporting to her and hundreds of millions of people around the world using products she helped build. The job made her worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But then something strange happened to Mayer, and people in the industry wondered what went wrong.

Mayer during her early Google days.



Google in its early days was a fun place to work, energized by incredible success and perks like free food. But it was also a grinding, stressful environment.

On Mayer’s second day at Google in 1999, she went to the kitchen for a snack at around 11 A.M. There, she bumped into Larry Page, then CEO of the company. He was standing in a corner.

“I'm hiding,” he said. “The site is down. It’s all gone horribly awry.”

He was exaggerating, of course. Google was actually doing too well at the moment.

In 1999, Google.com was a cleaner-looking and faster search engine than any of the others on the Web, and it was rapidly taking share from older search engines like AltaVista and Lycos. In fact, the site was down that day because Google had just signed a deal with Netscape to handle search queries from Netscape.com. Google only had 300 computers serving search results, and it asked Netscape to send just a fraction of its traffic. Netscape ignored the request and sent all of its users.

Down went Google.com.

Google went back online that day, but only after hours of work from Mayer, Silverstein, and her new colleagues. She went home at 3 a.m.

Perhaps because of long nights like that one, Mayer and Page eventually grew very close. At one point during Mayer’s early years at Google, she and Page started dating.

Long hours would prove the norm for Mayer. During her first two years at Google, she worked 100 hours a week as a programmer.

Mayer thrived working the tough hours. She only needed four hours of sleep a night, and when she was awake, she would work harder than anyone. She found a niche at Google: guardian of the clean, easy-to-use look and feel of Google products. She obsessed over pixels; their hue, shade, and placement. She co-authored a handful of patents, including an important one for Google: “Graphical user interface for a universal search engine.”

By 2005, Mayer moved into management, overseeing the look and feel of Google’s most important products.

She was very good at it.

Google

Mayer in 2005.

During her first several years at Google, Mayer had been able to continue teaching at Stanford. She taught 3,000 undergraduates by the time she was promoted, so the part of managing that has to do with leading, teaching, and organizing came easy to her. She enjoyed working with younger Google employees so much that she even started teaching classes at Google.

She created a mentorship program called “APM” which stood for “associated product manager.” Each year Mayer would select junior Google employees for the APM program, give them assignments, and teach them classes. Then, at the end of the program, Mayer would take the entire APM “class” on a weeklong trip abroad to Google offices around the globe.

When it came to developing Google products, Mayer had a bigger challenge.

Mayer has never been someone who easily relates with others. That’s why people call her robotic or “stuck up.” This trait is why people sometimes walk out of meetings with her feeling deeply insulted by a perceived slight.

But being in charge of how Google products should look, Mayer’s job was, basically, to relate with Google’s millions of users. How would she do that?

In the end, it proved to be an advantage for Mayer that empathy doesn’t come naturally to her. It forced her to be intentional about figuring out what users want and how they behave.

She came up with two clever methods of relating.




Google Marissa Mayer
Mayer at the height of her power at Google.

The first is that she would recreate the technological circumstances of her users in her own life. Mayer went without broadband for years in her home, refusing to install it until it was also installed in the majority of American homes. She carried an iPhone at Google, which makes Android phones, because so did most mobile Web users.

Mayer’s second method was to lean on data. She would track, survey, and measure every user interaction with Google products, and then use that data to design and re-design.

Mayer’s design-by-numbers approach to product development was not always popular.

Famously, a lead designer named Doug Bowman quit Google over it.

In a farewell blog post, Bowman wrote: “… a team at Google couldn’t decide between two blues, so they’re testing 41 shades between each blue to see which one performs better. I had a recent debate over whether a border should be 3, 4 or 5 pixels wide, and was asked to prove my case. I can’t operate in an environment like that. I’ve grown tired of debating such minuscule design decisions. There are more exciting design problems in this world to tackle.”

Bowman went to Twitter.

Mayer’s obsession with data-driven design would only gain more and louder critics over the years. But Mayer’s methods also made her one of the Internet’s most effective design and product development leaders during her years at Google. People at Google credit her with the success of not just Google search, but also many others, including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google News.

Google co-founder Sergey Brin says: “Marissa makes the decisions she feels are right, and history proves that she probably calls it right.”




Marissa Mayer in San Francisco Magazine
San Francisco Magazine

Julian Guthrie profiled Marissa Mayer in San Francisco Magazine's March 2008 issue.

Fame and Glory
As Google became a world-famous company, Mayer began to get attention from the media. Newsweek called her one of the “10 Tech Leaders of the Future.” Business 2.0 named her to the “Silicon Valley Dream Team.” Now-defunct technology news site Red Herring said Mayer was one of “15 Women to Watch.”

Then, in 2004, Google went public. Its stock price soared. This made Mayer and hundreds of her colleagues rich in an instant. The media’s fascination with Google kicked up several notches. Mayer, in charge of the look of Google’s most important product, and a rare photogenic woman in the technology industry, was a natural subject of the media’s fixation.

Mayer also boosted her public profile by deciding to spend her new riches conspicuously. She bought the $5 million penthouse suite at the Four Seasons in San Francisco, and another home closer to Google’s Mountain View campus. She started throwing fabulous parties at both, jumping feet first into San Francisco’s high-end social scene. Guests at her homes would see expensive original artwork from famous artists, like the 400-piece glass installation Mayer commissioned from Dale Chihuly.

Mayer did not mind the attention. In fact, she asked Google public relations staff to get her more of it, but in the right outlets.

Mayer’s eagerness to be known by the public may appear to contradict her claim that she suffers from shyness. It doesn’t. She describes her shyness as a need to withdraw from social situations almost as soon as she enters them. Being featured in a glossy magazine does not require her to interact with every reader, so she probably doesn’t have as much anxiety about it as she does making small talk at a party.

Plus, there is such a thing as overcompensation.




Marissa Mayer in Vogue
Mayer in Vogue in 2009

By the end of the decade, Vogue magazine would profile Mayer, and describe her as “the 34-year-old mega-millionaire, Oscar de la Renta-obsessed, computer-programming Google executive who lives in a penthouse atop the Four Seasons.”

Outside Google, her star was never brighter. Inside Google, however, where wealth was supposed to be quietly spent, and engineers were supposed to rule, Mayer would soon be under siege.

Demoted

At the end of 2010 and beginning of 2011, Marissa Mayer’s remarkable career suddenly lost momentum.

First, in Oct. 2010, Mayer was removed from the top of Google’s search organization and put in charge of Google Maps and other “local” products.

Technically, this was a lateral move, if not a promotion, because Mayer retained her vice president title and she was, at the same time, given a seat on Google’s Operating Committee — then CEO Eric Schmidt’s roundtable of top executives from the company.

In reality, it was a demotion. Mayer was no longer in charge of what Google’s most important product looked like or how it worked. At Google, there is search, which generates nearly all of the company’s revenues and profits, and then there is everything else. Running Google search, Mayer was managing the most important product at the world’s most important Internet company. Running Google Maps, she was not.

Still, there was the mitigating factor that Mayer was on Google’s Operating Committee, and she therefore reported directly to CEO Eric Schmidt.

That went away too.



Larry Page
By Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Google CEO Larry Page did not put Mayer on his executive team.

In December 2010, co-founder Larry Page announced that a decade after giving the CEO job up to Eric Schmidt, he was going to take it back.

When Page formally took control of Google in April 2011, he dissolved the Operating Committee and created a new council of executives who would report directly to him. This group came to be known as the “L-Team.” Mayer was not named to it.

Then, to make matters worse for Mayer, Page put another Google executive, Jeff Huber, in charge of “Geo/Local,” the group Mayer had been tasked to run only months before. Mayer now reported to Huber, who joined Google in 2003 — four years after her.

Mayer’s loss of authority was felt across the company. One former colleague says that prior to 2010, Mayer was always able to “get what she needed” from management.

“If her boss [Google senior vice president of product] Jonathan Rosenberg didn’t approve of something — didn’t give her head count or didn’t give her an acquisition or whatever — she’d just go right above him and get what she needed.”

That now stopped.

“She would try to do something and HR would say that’s not the kind of thing she could do anymore.”

“That whole paradigm broke apart.”

Another former colleague says, “When I first turned up, Marissa was very powerful at Google. Marissa used to issue edicts and everyone did them. Over time that proved not to be so true.”

Another way to track the rise and fall of Mayer at Google is to look at the company’s own, public list of executives in the “About Google” section of Google.com.

In November 2005, Mayer’s name and bio finally appeared on Google’s management page. By May 2011, her name was off the site.

What happened to Marissa Mayer’s career?

One explanation is that Mayer’s career stalled as 2010 ended and 2011 began because that is exactly when Larry Page decided he was going to become Google CEO again.

Because Mayer and Page had dated years before, some wonder if Page decided he could never allow Mayer to report directly to him because it would be unethical or show favoritism.

Everyone at Google had long known about the relationship, and no one ever made it an issue — it was too taboo to bring up.

One Googler explains: “Google is one of those places where, like a cult, there are things that are OK to talk about and things that are not OK to talk about. That was one of those things that was not OK to talk about.”

It’s actually hard to find someone at Google who was bothered by the fact that there once was a romantic relationship between Mayer and Page.

Perhaps this is because both of them have so publicly moved on.

Mayer and her husband, Zachary Bogue

In 2007, Page married a Stanford graduate student named Lucy Southworth. The ceremony was on Richard Branson’s private island.

That same year, a Google colleague emailed Mayer to say: “I’m bringing a boy I think you’d be interested in. Be cool.” The “boy” was Zachary Bogue. Tall and dark-haired, Bogue looks like he could be the star of “The Bachelor.” He had played football at Harvard, and was now a banker in San Francisco. In 2009, Mayer and Bogue married. Vogue covered the ceremony. Of their married life, he says: “We continue to do work in the evening. There’s never a distinct line between work and home. Marissa’s work is such a natural extension of her. It’s not something she needs to shed at the end of the day.”

It’s possible that Mayer’s romantic history with Page stalled her career at Google. But that’s not a widely held belief among Mayer’s former colleagues.

A more common explanation was that she may not have had the right kind of ambition to go much further.

There’s a philosophy that corporations exist to benefit three constituencies: shareholders, employees, and customers. At Google, there are two kinds of customers: the users of Google’s services and the advertisers who pay Google to be seen by users.

Mayer spent all her years at Google worried about just half of one of those constituencies: users.

To be fair, that was her job.

From Google’s earliest days, Mayer had always been tasked with making products that users love. And she pursued this task with a single-minded passion, sleeping four hours a night, working 100-hour weeks, grinding through back-to-back meetings without breaks.

But Mayer may have been a bit too single-minded in this pursuit — at least for the sake of her future at Google.

Compared to some Google executives who joined the company around the same time as Mayer, Mayer showed much less interest in learning about the business side of the company.

One former Google executive who worked in ad sales says, “I did not work with her, and that’s telling.”

This executive says that even before Mayer joined Google’s Operating Committee, she had an open invitation to join its meetings — out of respect for her importance to the company and in an effort to develop her career. But while Mayer would always show up for meetings about Google’s products, “she would never show up for a business review.”

By contrast, two of Mayer’s peers — Susan Wojcicki and Jeff Huber — “would make the time and be there because they were interested in expanding their horizons.”

By 2010, when Mayer’s Google career started stalling, Wojcicki and Huber were getting promotions. Both would end up reporting directly to Larry Page. Huber would become Mayer’s boss. Today, Wojcicki is considered one of the two or three most powerful executives at Google.

Mayer missed several of these types of opportunities. In the months before he became CEO again, Larry Page would hold two-hour, post-Operating Committee meetings on Mondays that were more focused on long-term strategy.

One executive who was flattered to be invited says, “I was pretty interested in understanding the connection between Chrome and Android.”

But Mayer would hardly ever show, “either because she was traveling or who knows.”

Several of the regular attendees at those meetings ended up with positions reporting directly to Page.

One of them was Sundar Pichai, now leading development of both Google’s Chrome and Android products. Pichai’s ascent had to be bittersweet to Mayer. He used to work for her, and she had promoted him. Now he was passing her by.




Google Chrome VP Sundar Pichai
Matt Rosoff

Sundar Pichai

But a former colleague says Pichai was a perfect contrast to Mayer when it came to being involved with Google as a whole.

“Sundar would do anything to help the company. He was internally working cross-functionally to get results. If someone was offline and didn’t get the strategy he’d sit down with them one-on-one. He really put work into it. Marissa didn’t do that at all.”

One of Mayer’s former colleagues says she skipped all those meetings because, when it came to the business side of Google, Mayer was always “less interested.”

“She has a disposition toward the consumer side, and users.”

This trait undoubtedly shaped Mayer’s career at Google, and it would be very important later at Yahoo.

But more than her lack of interest in the business side of Google, and certainly more than her history with Page, there was one overriding reason for Marissa Mayer’s sudden decline in power.

Her great strength, her teacherly I-know-best leadership style had finally begun to grate on people at Google. Worse, it had begun to slow the company down.

Eventually, a group of Google engineers decided to try and do something about it.

John Battelle, who has put on several large tech conferences in the Bay Area, many of them featuring Marissa Mayer as a speaker, says of her: “I've never had a conversation with her when she wasn’t completely certain she was right.”

This pedantic style works when you are the traffic cop in a room full of designers and product managers, but it alienated some of Mayer’s colleagues over the years.




salar kamangar
http://ashleyannphotography.com

Mayer and and Salar Kamangar clashed often.

One peer it irked in particular was Salar Kamangar. Now the CEO of Google-owned YouTube, Kamangar joined Google as its ninth employee. He drafted its original business plan, and handled financing and legal early on. Younger than Mayer, he rose along with her at Google, though not as conspicuously.

Mayer and Kamangar clashed often.

The specific habit of Mayer’s that drove Kamangar nuts was her ability to speak incredibly fast, not allowing him to re-enter the debate.

“In an academic situation, that’s OK because the best ideas rise and you have discussion,” says one Googler, familiar with Kamangar’s complaints about Mayer. “But in a place where there are personal feelings involved, if you can’t win the debate regardless of how hard you try, because she will out-talk you, that’s a challenging situation.”

The rivalry between Mayer and Kamangar was so intense that when Kamangar was made a vice president before her, she threatened to quit the company. She got her promotion months later.

Another Mayer habit that annoyed colleagues was one she picked up straight from academia.

For many years at Google, Mayer insisted that if her colleagues wanted to speak with her, they had to do so during her “office hours.” Mayer would post a spreadsheet online, and ask that anyone who wanted to speak with her sign up for a five-minute window.

When Mayer’s “office hours” rolled around in the afternoon, a line would start to form outside of her office and spill over into the nearby couches.

“Office hours” are socially acceptable in an academic environment because the power dynamic is clear. The students are subordinate to the professor, usually their elder and mentor.

But Mayer’s office hours were not just for her subordinates, but also her peers.

So there, amid the associate product managers waiting to visit with Mayer to discuss their latest assignment or a class trip to Zurich, sat Google vice presidents — people who had been at the company as long as Mayer, and in some cases held jobs as important as hers.

What made the “office hours” even more obnoxious for some Google engineers and product managers was that all consumer-facing product launches or updates required Mayer’s sign-off.

“Her weakness was an unwillingness to delegate,” says Craig Silverstein, the Google engineer who hired Mayer years ago. “She doesn’t need any sleep. When you have four or five more hours in the day than most people do, you don’t learn to delegate because you don’t need to.”

The team who grew most frustrated with Mayer over the “office hours” and, more generally, the need for her to sign off on product changes, were the engineers in charge of Google search.



Amit Singhal of Google
sigir2006

One story is that Amit Singhal told Larry Page that Mayer had to go.

Several of Mayer’s former Google colleagues confirm that among the most put off was Amit Singhal.

While Mayer was in charge of the way Google Search looked, Singhal, was one of the engineers in charge of creating the algorithms that actually power the search engine. After he re-wrote Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s original code in 2001, he was named a “Google Fellow.” He’s a big deal inside the company.

One of Mayer’s former Google colleagues says that it was actually Singhal and three other search engineers who finally went to Larry Page and asked that Mayer be removed from the top of Google’s search organization.

“These four guys, they were constantly being hampered. They’d say: ‘We want to roll out this ranking change.’ Marissa’s like, ‘until I review it, you can’t launch it.’ They’re like: ‘But it’s been three weeks.’”

Finally, says this source, Singhal and the other engineers went to Larry Page and said, “Take your pick. Her, or us.”

In this person’s telling, Page made his choice and that’s why Mayer was moved out of search. She had become a bottleneck.

Other people say Page removed Mayer from her perch atop search after lots of input from lots of people.

Says one Googler: “What Larry saw as he became CEO was that Marissa has a tough user-interface that causes problems with other stakeholders.”

Another Googler familiar with those discussions says: “Everyone agreed that something needed to change.”

This Googler wonders if Mayer was unfairly punished in 2010 and 2011.

“Sometimes she got into trouble because she’s ambitious and a woman and that’s tough in a man’s world. People take potshots at her because she was very young and successful. I also think she’s young and learning and you sometimes don’t get things right.”

Another reason for Mayer’s career stall in 2011 was that Google, as a company, had grown up.

By 2010, Google had 24,000 employees. It wasn’t going to be the kind of place where, just because an executive had been there a long time and knew the co-founders personally, she was going to be able to get whatever she wanted.

“You couldn’t run the company like that anymore,” says one person who lived through the transition.

“As you grow you have to hire people who have done this stuff before, and having people who haven’t lord over them doesn’t work.”

So, by early 2011, Marissa Mayer’s progress at Google had stalled. But another, greater opportunity was about to come her way.

On the afternoon of Monday, July 16, 2012, Yahoo chief revenue officer Michael Barrett stood at a gate in New York’s JFK airport, waiting to board a plane to London.




AdMeld CEO Michael Barrett
AdMeld

Michael Barrett had only joined Yahoo weeks before Mayer.

Suddenly, his phone rang. It was a reporter. She said, “Oh my God. You have a new boss. What do you think?”

The reporter told Barrett the news: Yahoo had a new CEO. It was Marissa Mayer from Google.

Barrett was shocked.

Barrett himself had only joined Yahoo from Google less than a month before.

Barrett’s job at Google had been a good one. He’d only left because Yahoo chairman Fred Amoroso had told him that interim CEO Ross Levinsohn was going to get the full-time job.

As Barrett got back off the plane, he thought: What the hell happened?

- - -

The story of how Marissa Mayer came to Yahoo begins in the summer of 2011.

That’s when Dan Loeb, the manager of a hedge fund called Third Point, decided he could make a lot of money investing in Yahoo if he could force a few people to quit its board and install a CEO of his choosing.

There were two simple reasons Loeb believed Yahoo was a worthwhile investment, despite a decade of mismanagement. The first was that 700 million or so people still went to Yahoo.com every month, even though the company hadn’t come up with a cool new product in years.

The second was that Yahoo had made a brilliant investment in two Asian Internet companies, Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan, and Loeb did not believe this investment was being taken advantage of by management.

So Loeb took a 5 percent stake in Yahoo and began a letter-writing, shareholder-activist campaign to unseat its CEO and several of its board members. In his letters, Loeb accurately pointed out that Yahoo had been mismanaged for a decade, and that it was largely the board’s fault. In December, Yahoo’s board hoped to appease Loeb by hiring PayPal president Scott Thompson to be Yahoo’s new CEO.

Loeb was not appeased. Publicly, he began lobbying Thompson to install new board members. Privately, Loeb asked a consultant he’d hired, former MTV president Michael Wolf, to begin looking for someone who could replace Thompson.



Michael Wolf by David Needleman
David Needleman

Dan Loeb asked Michael Wolf to find a CEO for Yahoo.

With this mission in mind, Loeb and Wolf flew to San Francisco for a series of meetings in January 2012.

One morning during their trip, Loeb and Wolf drove south to meet with venture capitalist Marc Andreessen for breakfast at his house. Famous for co-founding Netscape, the original Web browser company, Andreessen had gone on to found two other billion-dollar companies and a successful venture capital firm. By the winter of 2012, Andreessen had become Silicon Valley’s go-to wise man.

Loeb and Wolf asked Andreessen if he’d join their slate for Yahoo’s board. He refused to participate in a deal perceived to be hostile to Yahoo’s founders and current management, but said he was happy to talk about Yahoo strategy.

The New Yorkers asked him: Whom should Yahoo hire: a media person or a product person?

By a “media person,” they meant an executive who could run Yahoo almost like a television network or magazine publisher, but on the Internet. This person’s specialties would be the ability to identify great content, close deals with the people who create it and those who could distribute it, and the skill set to sell ads against it. CBS chief executive Les Moonves and former News Corp chief operating officer Peter Chernin are this kind of executive. So was Michael Eisner when he spent 20 years transforming Disney from a sleepy studio into a corporate giant.

By a “product person,” Loeb and Wolf meant someone who could get teams of engineers and designers to build software tools that consumers find useful, addictive, or fun. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is this kind of executive. So was Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs.

Almost since its beginning, Yahoo had struggled with its identity.

Should it act like a “media” company — one that tries to attract consumers by producing and buying content and distributing it through Yahoo.com? Or should Yahoo act like a “products” company — where Internet software tools like search, Webmail, stock charts, and photo storage attract users?



Marc Andreessen
AP

Marc Andreessen

Andreessen said: If you get the chance to run Yahoo, the only way you'll be able to save it is if you hire someone who can make great Yahoo products.

Andreessen talked about the difference between technology companies and “normal” companies. He said the output of normal companies is their product: cars, shoes, life insurance. In his view, the output of technologies companies is innovation. Whatever they are selling today, they will be selling something different in five years. If they stop innovating, they die.

Andreessen said the person at the top of Yahoo needs to know how to pioneer and produce a steady stream of innovative products if the company was going to survive in a competition with large companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple or even some of the Valley’s many startups.

The message stuck.

In May 2012, Loeb finally figured out a way to get Scott Thompson out of the CEO job.

Loeb learned that Thompson had graduated from Stonehill College in 1979 with a bachelor’s degree in accounting — not a “bachelor’s degree in accounting and computer science” as Yahoo claimed on its website, and more importantly, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from April.

On May 3, Loeb drafted a letter containing this information, and sent it to the Yahoo board and the SEC, which would publish it for the public. On May 13, Thompson resigned, citing health issues.

Scott Thompson resigned from Yahoo after Dan Loeb revealed his bio was false.

The Yahoo board, which had hired Thompson without the help of an outside executive search firm, also capitulated. In a legal settlement, it gave Loeb much of what he’d been asking for since the summer before.

Five directors resigned immediately. Loeb and Wolf gained board seats, and more importantly, the chairmanship of two important committees. Loeb would chair the board’s transaction committee, which meant he would have sign-off power on any sale of Yahoo’s valuable Asian assets. Wolf would lead the executive search committee, which had the immediate task of finding Yahoo’s next CEO.

Wolf had someone in mind — just the kind of “products” CEO Andreessen had recommended. He hired executive recruiter Jim Citrin of Spencer Stuart, and gave him a description of the Yahoo CEO job.

The document Wolf gave Citrin said Yahoo needed to hire someone who can “modernize” Yahoo’s “user experiences” on mobile devices by building a culture that attracts the best “content, developer, product innovation, advertising, marketing and managerial talent.” The document said the board sought someone who could “re-establish Yahoo!’s credibility and reputation in the tech-innovator community” and build partnerships with companies such as “Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon.”

At Citrin’s first meeting with the board the week of May 21, 2012, he told the directors there were only a few people in the industry who could do the job described in Wolf’s document. Citrin said those people were at companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google. He said that it was going to be very difficult for Yahoo to hire any of them.

The board came up with a list of candidates for Citrin to approach.

Though he was a “media,” not a “products” executive, the top prospect for most of the directors was Ross Levinsohn, who became interim Yahoo CEO when Thompson stepped down.

Levinsohn, who worked in Yahoo’s Santa Monica office, is the kind of executive who looks like he belongs in the CEO’s office of a west coast entertainment company. He'll point at the camera when he’s having his picture taken. He’s got a wide smile. His hair is combed back. He wears suits. He looks good in the fleece zip-up sweater vests they give out at Allen & Co’s Sun Valley conference for media moguls.

Levinsohn joined Yahoo in October 2010 as an executive vice president in charge of the “Americas” region. Levinsohn had impressed shareholders with his performance at Yahoo’s annual shareholder meeting in 2011, when he presented a vision for Yahoo as “the world’s premier digital media company.” For a moment, he’d ended the confusion about what kind of company Yahoo was — a “product” company or a “media” company. To many directors, it seemed like Levinsohn understood the value of Yahoo’s audience, and had a plan to tap it.



Eddy Cue Apple

Apple's Eddy Cue was a candidate for the Yahoo CEO job.

Among the other names were Nikesh Arora, the chief business officer at Google; Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services; and Jason Kilar, then the CEO of Web TV site Hulu.

The board also asked Citrin to approach Google’s Marissa Mayer.

Citrin cautioned that Mayer appeared to be a lifer at Google and was unlikely to be interested in the job.

Many of the directors wondered whether Mayer was actually capable of leading a large public corporation. They asked question like: Had she ever managed a balance sheet? Hadn’t she been demoted only a year before?

Citrin said he’d call Mayer anyway.

In the middle of June 2012, Marissa Mayer sat on a plane, thinking and preparing. That Monday, she’d gotten a call from Jim Citrin of executive search firm Spencer Stuart. He’d been retained by Yahoo, and he had Yahoo director Michael Wolf with him.

Would she like to speak to Wolf? She would.

Now Mayer was flying to New York to have dinner at Wolf’s Manhattan apartment with Wolf, Citrin, and three other Yahoo directors: David Kenny, John Hayes, and Thomas McInerney.

After 13 years at Google, she was surprised to find herself actually, finally, truly considering leaving.

The past two years at Google — since she was, according to the rest of the world “demoted” — had been quieter than the first 11, but in many ways more challenging and exciting.

In local and geo, she’d taken over a much more massive operation than the one she’d been running at Google.

Whenever people asked her about the “demotion,” as Wolf and the other directors might over dinner, Mayer always pointed out how she had gone from managing 250 product managers in search to supervising a much larger, more diverse group of managers — 1,100 people managing engineering, design, marketing, and sales. Mayer would tell people that she was supervising some 6,000 contractors.

She’d figured out that by the fraction of the company, the geo and local piece that she was running was something like 20-25 percent of the company’s overall headcount.

The business challenges she’d dealt with in those years had been as diverse as the types of people she managed.

In September 2011, she went and bought Zagat for $125 million. It was not the kind of deal someone who had been “demoted” could do. It was Google’s 10th-largest acquisition ever. More than that, the integration of Zagat into Google search signaled a major change in Google’s philosophy.

Previously, the company had steadfastly refused to own or produce content that would show up in its search engine. It would just index what was already out there being created by the rest of the world.

But after Mayer joined geo in 2010, she found that the “rest of the world” wasn’t as good at gathering geographic data and putting it on the Web as it was creating websites for Google to index. So she decided it was time for Google to start owning data. Her boss, Jeff Huber, and Larry Page had backed her on the deal and the philosophical change, and now Google had lots of content for location-based searches — a popular kind of search to do on mobile, which was quickly becoming the future of the Internet.

Even as Mayer was on the plane, she was playing a crucial part in helping Google fend off one of its toughest competitors in mobile: Apple. Months before, she’d noticed that Apple had started buying companies in the mapping space. Then executive recruiters sent by Apple had started reaching out to her people.

Obviously, they were up to something big. Mayer didn’t know — Apple would never announce it until it was done — but she figured it planned to remove Google Maps from the iPhone and replace it with its own Apple Maps. She’d already countered Apple’s offers by giving her people what they really wanted. Sometimes it was raises. Sometimes it was independence. Sometimes it was new titles. Sometimes it was actually more work, more responsibility. She knew what her people wanted. None of her reports ended up quitting to join Apple. Now, Mayer had her team working on a new Google Maps app for iPhone. She was confident it was going to beat anything Apple’s people could come up with.

Mayer knew that her job switch in 2010 looked like a demotion to some people outside the company — especially people in the media. But as she flew to New York that day in June 2012, Marissa Mayer knew that she’d spent the previous two years learning a lot from a bigger job than she’d ever had before.

And now she knew that she was ready for an even bigger one.

On the evening of June 24, Mayer arrived at Wolf’s modern, Fifth Avenue apartment. An informal dinner was served.

Mayer read for the part of Yahoo CEO.

Throughout the conversation, Mayer touted a surprisingly thought-out plan for overhauling Yahoo’s culture, executive suite, and product line-up.

After Mayer left, one of the board directors said to Citrin: “That’s the next CEO of Yahoo.” The committee agreed that Wolf would stay in touch with her.

One of the directors noticed something funny, but decided to keep it to himself. Wolf had served a very expensive bottle of wine, and Mayer hadn’t had a sip. Probably she was just nervous.

Wolf wants to hire Mayer, but everyone else?

After that dinner, Wolf, the chair of Yahoo’s search committee, had decided that Marissa Mayer should be the next CEO of Yahoo.

With her experience running cornerstone Google products like Search, Google Maps, and Gmail, she was exactly the kind of innovative, products-oriented CEO that Silicon Valley wise man Marc Andreessen had told him to hire back in January.

But Wolf, and his pro-Mayer allies on the board, had a problem.

By mid-June, other Yahoo directors had already all but decided that interim CEO Ross Levinsohn should get the full-time job.

When Thompson resigned in the middle of May, and Levinsohn was named interim CEO, new chairman Fred Amoroso pulled Levinsohn aside and told him to run Yahoo like he was going to be the full-time CEO. After that conversation, Levinsohn sent a memo to all of Yahoo’s employees. He wrote, “I’m fired up and I hope you are too. I believe in the power of what we’re doing. We have an incredibly talented team, unparalleled strengths in key areas and most importantly, I see the purple pride building everywhere. Let’s move forward quickly with conviction and confidence.”

Levinsohn ran with the opportunity, and by the end of June — really, just a few weeks — he’d accomplished a lot. He’d signed a deal with Facebook over patents. He was able to quickly recruit impressive executives into Yahoo, including Google advertising executive Michael Barrett. Levinsohn and his top dealmaker, Jim Heckman, were also able to nail down several content partnerships in just a few weeks, including one with on-demand music service Spotify. Levinsohn and Heckman were also busy working on much larger deals with Microsoft, Google, and a fast-growing ad tech company based in New York called AppNexus.

As Levinsohn worked hard to earn the full-time job, Yahoo directors began to come under pressure from the rest of the industry to hand him the job. Levinsohn’s allies across the media, advertising, and entertainment industries wrote Yahoo directors letters recommending him.

LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner and cofounder Reid Hoffman lobbied for Ross Levinsohn.

At The Wall Street Journal’s D: All Things Digital conference, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner and LinkedIn co-founder and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman enthusiastically endorsed Levinsohn, and said Yahoo would finally be in good hands if it put him in charge.

After several weeks went by without Yahoo naming a full-time replacement for Thompson, even Marc Andreessen wrote a note to Loeb suggesting that Yahoo should just put Levinsohn in the job permanently and commit to a media strategy, since it seemed unlikely they could get a top-end product CEO, and continued delays would permanently damage the company.

Meanwhile, All Things D reporter Kara Swisher — who had, over the years, covered Yahoo closer than anyone thanks to board-level sources — seemed to be actively pushing for Yahoo to hire Levinsohn. She said the only reason the board hadn’t hired him yet was that it was looking for a “unicorn CEO — one who actually does not exist but who sounds just dreamy.”

By the beginning of July, several board members were almost completely sold. They wanted Levinsohn to keep the job.

The top secret interviews

The Four Seasons in Palo Alto

On the morning of Wednesday, July 11, 2012, a small bus pulled in front of the Four Seasons Hotel in East Palo Alto, California; a squat all-glass building in the middle of a parking lot next to a highway. As the bus idled, about a dozen middle-aged executives quietly boarded.

These executives were the Yahoo board of directors, and as they boarded that bus, they had no idea where they were going. Their destination was a secret because these people — people who would soon have to come together and decide the fate of Yahoo — did not trust each other.

That day, the board was going to interview, for the last time, four finalist candidates for the Yahoo CEO job.

The search committee had decided that if the entire board knew where the final interviews were taking place, one of the directors would inevitably leak the location to All Things D reporter Kara Swisher. For years, the aviators-wearing, tough-talking Swisher had been reporting Yahoo layoffs, firings, hirings, and acquisitions before they actually happened. The new directors assumed she had a source, or sources, on the old board, and they were determined not to provide her new ones.

Six days before, Swisher had reported, accurately, that the board was considering Hulu CEO Jason Kilar for the job. The report had made things awkward for Kilar with Hulu’s corporate parents, Disney and News Corporation, and he’d pulled himself out of the running — taking a good option away from the board. Some members of the board felt Swisher had meant to nuke Kilar in order to help Levinsohn get the job. (Swisher denies this, and there isn't any evidence to back the allegation.)

David Kenny was particularly insistent on secrecy. The fall prior, before Scott Thompson was hired, Kenny had interviewed for the CEO job at Yahoo. Word of his meetings in Sunnyvale had gotten out, and Kenny had to resign from Akamai, where he was president. Kenny recovered nicely — he’d become the CEO of The Weather Channel — but he didn’t want the same thing happening to any of the executives interviewing that day.

The directors rode in the bus for exactly five miles — south on University, south on 101, off the highway at Oregon Expressway, and continuing onto Page Mill road.

This is the secret location of the Yahoo CEO interviews

After 10 to 15 minutes, the the bus pulled into an office park, and everyone got out.

They’d arrived at the offices of Third Point’s law firm, Gibson Dunn. The location was ostensibly picked by headhunter Jim Citrin, who’d also arranged the buses. But some of the directors took it as a signal from the Third Point board members about whose show this really was.

Citrin had also arranged for a car to pick up Levinsohn. He had no idea where he was going, either. He also didn’t know who the other finalists were.

Levinsohn went first. He presented his plan, which the board was familiar with by then. He wanted to get Yahoo out of the “platform” business, where it was competing with Google, Microsoft, and Facebook — and move it into the content business. Levinsohn knew some of the directors were worried that he’d ignore Yahoo’s engineers and product development people, so he talked about how he’d been spending a lot of time with product boss Shashi Seth and his team.

The interview felt strange to Levinsohn. He’d been talking to Loeb a handful of times, every day. He said, “You guys know where I’m at. You know what I'm doing.”

After, Jim Citrin told Levinsohn he’d done well. Levinsohn was told that if the board decided to go in the “media” direction, the job was his.

Levinsohn left.

After enough time had passed to ensure that they wouldn’t spot each other, Mayer arrived by limo.

Anyone remotely familiar with her childhood, studies, and career could have predicted what happened next.

Mayer walked into that room at Gibson Dunn and blew them away.

She described her long familiarity with Yahoo and its products. She described how Yahoo products would evolve over time under her watch. Her presentation included an extraordinary amount of detail on Yahoo’s search business, audience analytics, and data. She talked about fixing Yahoo’s culture with more transparency, perks, and accountability. She named her perceived weaknesses, and explained how she planned to address them — including by hiring people who had the skills she didn’t have.

When Mayer was done, Jim Citrin told her he’d call her with the board’s decision by 8 p.m.

She left. The board still had a tough final decision to make.

A number of the Yahoo directors still opposed hiring Mayer. They argued that she didn’t have enough corporate experience. Some of the directors favored Levinsohn because they felt that the Third Point directors were just trying to install someone they could control. They had not overlooked that the “secret” location of the final interviews had been the offices of Third Point’s lawyers.

Brad Smith worried Mayer didn't have enough corporate experience.

The directors who opposed Mayer — most vocally Amoroso, but also Brad Smith and David Kenny — argued that Levinsohn, with his “media” strategy, had a better plan for Yahoo than Mayer and her “products” strategy.

They argued that Mayer may present a greater upside — she was more likely to come up with the next Facebook or Google Maps or Twitter — but that Levinsohn was the safer bet, a more guaranteed return.

Loeb, who had fought a bloody fight to get onto the board, and whose vote undoubtedly mattered the most, didn’t mind that Mayer was a high-risk, high-reward play. In his view, the sale of Yahoo’s Asian assets and the returning of those proceeds through share buybacks or dividends would provide enough of a “floor” in Yahoo’s value that it was worth betting on the greater upside Mayer brought to the table.

The 8 p.m. deadline came and went. Mayer, at a dinner party on the other side of town, tried to stop checking her phone.

At 9:45 p.m., the board still hadn’t called her. She signaled to her husband, Zachary Bogue, that she wanted to leave the party.

Wolf lobbied his fellow directors in favor of Mayer to the point of annoyance.

Finally, the pro-Mayer directors proposed a solution. What if they made Mayer the CEO and offered Levinsohn a huge amount of money to stay on as her chief operating officer? That way she’d be able to pursue her “products” strategy, and he could keep running the sales force and making deals with major media companies.

An informal vote was cast. The pro-Mayer directors were in the majority, with Amoroso and others voting against.

It was over. A formal vote was cast.

This time the board unanimously voted to name Marissa Mayer the new CEO of Yahoo.

Meanwhile, Mayer and Bogue had decided to stay at their dinner party, but it was finally time to go. As they began to say their goodbyes, Mayer’s phone finally rang. It was Jim Citrin. She let it go to voicemail.



The night after she interviewed, Jim Citrin left a message on Mayer's phone: “Marissa … you should be smiling. We’re smiling. Call me ASAP.”
Spencer Stuart

Jim Citrin called Marissa Mayer to offer her the job.

Citrin told her: “Marissa … you should be smiling. We’re smiling. Call me ASAP.”

When the board reached Mayer to offer her the job, she did not accept it right away. First she had some news to share.

She was five months pregnant. That’s why she hadn’t touched her wine at Michael Wolf’s apartment the month before.

The offer stood. After three days of negotiation with Wolf, she accepted.

The morning after Mayer got the voicemail from Citrin, Levinsohn was unaware that his fate had already been sealed. Once again he presented his plan for Yahoo to the board — this time with his executive team there to fill in the details.

He’d woken up that morning still feeling confident that he was going to get the job. But this was the meeting where, midway through, Loeb left to go to the bathroom and Wolf stood with Wilson to loudly question the deals Heckman had been negotiating with Google, Microsoft, and others.

Levinsohn went into the weekend at Allen & Co.’s mogul conference at Sun Valley sure he’d lost the job, but unsure to whom. By Sunday, Ross Levinsohn had found out that the board had also interviewed Marissa Mayer. When he heard her name, he knew it was over.

On Monday, Levinsohn went to work. Yahoo had to report its second quarter earnings that week, and he worked with CFO Tim Morse’s team to prepare some remarks for the company’s conference call with analysts. Levinsohn kept telling the team, “don’t write this for me, write it for a CEO. It should be generic.”

When that was done, Levinsohn went back to his office to wait for the news. He’d wanted this job. He’d fought for it. He’d done well.

Fred Amoroso broke the bad news to Levinsohn.

Finally, Fred Amoroso walked into Levinsohn's office and delivered the blow.

Back in New York and barely off a British Airways plane now heading for London, Michael Barrett joined a conference call with other top Yahoo executives.

Amoroso explained the news.

He said, “We love Ross. We thank Ross. We want him to stay. We weren’t looking for someone like Marissa, but when she showed up, boy were we impressed.”

“Although it was a hard decision, and we think Ross is doing a great job, she brings a different level of perspective and talent to the organization we couldn’t pass up.”

On Tuesday, July 17, 2012, David Filo stood waiting at the entrance of Yahoo’s headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif. He was very excited.

Filo is a quiet, unassuming engineer for Yahoo. He works in a cubicle. He also happens to be a co-founder of the company.

Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and co-founder David Filo.



In 2012, Filo still owned 6 percent of Yahoo. He was its largest individual shareholder. According to Forbes, there were only 959 people on the planet with more money than him.

And yet, the reason Filo was waiting near the entrance of Yahoo was so that when Marissa Mayer arrived, he would be able to unfurl a long purple carpet before her feet.

Yahoo’s hero was coming. But huge challenges faced her.

Yahoo’s websites were getting fewer and fewer visitors every year. Meanwhile, Yahoo’s mobile apps were being largely ignored.

For years, Yahoo’s most talented executives and engineers had been quitting the company to join faster-moving rivals like Facebook and Google. Those who stayed at Yahoo tended to show up late and leave early, or log in from home. Mayer had to fix Yahoo’s culture.

Mayer also walked into the office that day seven months pregnant. Her new colleagues looked to see if she was showing. They wondered how in the world she would manage a baby and the huge job ahead of her.

Marissa Mayer HOPE posterThe excitement was everywhere in the building. One enthusiastic Yahoo employee had made a poster with Mayer’s face on it in the style of Shepard Fairey’s 2008 campaign poster for Barack Obama. Across the lower third, the poster has one word in all-caps: “HOPE.”

When she finally arrived, Mayer’s first job was to meet the one group of Yahoo employees who were not as excited by her arrival — Yahoo’s senior executives, several of whom had risen to their jobs thanks to Ross Levinsohn.

Levinsohn, despite personal pleas from Amoroso and whispers of a generous compensation package, was not staying as Mayer’s chief operating officer. Since he took the interim job in May, he’d warned the board that if he didn’t get the permanent gig, he was going to try to become a CEO somewhere else.

If Levinsohn ever had any notion of reconsidering, that was squashed by his first scheduled meeting with Mayer.

After he’d learned that she was getting the job, he’d flown back home to Los Angeles. When Mayer said she wanted to meet, he agreed to fly back up to Sunnyvale. But when he showed up at their appointed time, Mayer’s assistant told Levinsohn she was running late.

Levinsohn said to the assistant, “My office is three doors down. I'll be in there.”

Suddenly anxious, the assistant said: “You have to wait here.”

She wanted him to wait so that when Mayer was done with whatever she was doing, he would be immediately available.

Levinsohn said, “Not so much.” He walked away.

Soon he walked out of the building for good.

Levinsohn decided that no good would come of him staying. He could see what would happen: Yahoo would devolve into a place where there were his people and there were Mayer’s people. The whole “media” versus “products” battle would rage on, and it would be an ugly fight.

And so, feeling that the rug had just been ripped out from underneath them, Yahoo’s senior executives walked into Mayer’s new office at Yahoo — the one Fred Amoroso had been using days before.

Many of these people were meeting Mayer for the first time, and they expected to sit across from the woman they’d read about in so many fluffy profiles and had seen on TV or onstage at conferences — someone who was charismatic and warm; personal.

That was not what they got.




Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer takes notes
TechCrunch

One by one, they walked in and sat down at a table across from Mayer. Then, she launched into questions. She asked: “Where did you get your education?” “Where are you from?” “What do you do here?” And so on.

As Yahoo executives answered, Mayer took notes on their answers with pen on paper, hardly looking up.

“It kind of felt like you were summoned to the principal’s office,” says one executive who went through one of these introductory meetings with Mayer.

“You would have thought a fair portion of [that meeting] would have been about ‘so what are you going through? How are you feeling? Sorry about Ross. We love him. We’d like to keep him. Realistically, he won’t stay but that doesn’t have any impact on you.’

“There wasn’t any kind of commiseration or any kind of bear hug. There wasn’t even a question of ‘Are you in or are you out?’ It was: ‘I assume you’re in. Let me know otherwise.’

“There was no time for short conversation or human emotions. It was very boom, boom, boom.

“Most people walked away from that meeting saying, ‘Holy shit.’”

One Yahoo executive attended such an introductory meeting between his boss and Mayer. His boss asked Mayer “Would you like to meet the people I brought?”

Mayer looked at them.

“No.”

The truth is, the person Yahoo’s top executives sat across from in those first meetings was not the Marissa Mayer they thought they knew from the media coverage of her. It was the Marissa Mayer her Stanford classmate Josh Elman remembers from late night study sessions.

Just as during those all-nighters almost 20 years before, Mayer wasn’t at Yahoo to socialize. In one early meeting Mayer said that Yahoo was going to fail — shut down — in the next few years if it did not get things going soon. She told a top product executive that Yahoo lagged in innovation and talent, and that its culture was broken.

She was there to save the company, and that was going to take a lot of work. It was past time to get started.

Some of the executives Mayer met with had a hard time connecting with her. Just as some of her Stanford study mates mistook her shyness for being “stuck up,” some of her new Yahoo colleagues took her all-business attitude as being “demeaning.”

For the people who were making Yahoo’s products at the time, the meetings were even more intense.

A designer or a top product manager would sit down and Mayer would assault them with a series of questions.

“How was that researched?”

“What was the research methodology?”

“How did you back that up?”

One person who went through a Mayer grilling says, “It was scary for a lot of people because of its intensity.”



Jim Heckman
jdlasica

Jim Heckman's and Marissa Mayer's personalities clashed.

The most pivotal meeting Mayer had in her first few days at Yahoo was with Levinsohn’s dealmaker, Jim Heckman.

She had to learn exactly what Heckman had been negotiating with Yahoo’s competitors. She had to decide whether or not to finalize these deals or to unwind them altogether. More broadly, Mayer had to understand the direction Heckman and Levinsohn had been taking Yahoo, and decide whether to keep it going that way or to slam on the brakes.

It is possible that, in the history of business, there has never been a meeting between two people whose personalities, styles, and priorities clash more than Mayer’s and Heckman’s.

Mayer is passionate about the pixels in the picture. She’s shy. She’s careful. She’s bold, but not reckless. She’s idealistic about people. She'll pay $60,000 to meet a designer, but wear his dress modestly.

Jim Heckman breaks glass. He’s squinty-eyed and caffeinated. He makes deals. He uses your first name. He quotes the comedian Daniel Tosh of Tosh.0. He doesn’t care about the headcount; he cares about the bottom line. Once, at a Yahoo party held on a yacht during the Cannes Lions Festival in France, Heckman brought a date who decided to go topless. There was a lot of shouting on the yacht.

Heckman met with Mayer during her first few days at Yahoo. Heckman laid out the plan he and Levinsohn had been working on for the past year. If implemented it would have completely changed the way Yahoo did business.

Yahoo makes its money by selling advertising. Heckman and Levinsohn believed that Yahoo had spent too much money and too much time trying to invent advertising technology that would allow Yahoo to charge higher ad rates. He believed that companies like Google, Microsoft, and AppNexus were far ahead of Yahoo in the world of ad tech, and that Yahoo was better off partnering with one of those companies and getting rid of the people it employed to work on ad tech.

Heckman told Mayer he believed partner ad technology would immediately raise Yahoo’s ad rates.

Moreover, with the money Yahoo would save by getting rid of the people it had working on ad tech, it could go out and buy high quality video content from Hollywood studios. He argued that advertisers would be willing to pay much higher ad rates if Yahoo’s content quality were higher. He said rates could go from under $2 per 1,000 impressions to $20.

In Heckman’s vision, Yahoo.com was more like a cable TV provider with a large, installed audience, than it was a maker of technology products.



Steve Ballmer Microsoft
Microsoft

Steve Ballmer was ready to give MSN.com to Yahoo.

Heckman said he already had a deal negotiated with Google executive Henrique De Castro to begin using Google’s advertising technology instead of Yahoo’s.

Heckman said the same theory could be applied to other second-, third-, or fourth-place Yahoo businesses. He talked about how Boeing lets General Electric, Rolls-Royce, and Pratt-Whitney make the actual engines for its airplanes.

He told Mayer that he’d negotiated a deal with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, wherein Yahoo would turn over its entire search business — patents and all — in exchange for Microsoft’s large online media property, MSN.com, and long-term, guaranteed cash payments.

Heckman said his plan would allow Yahoo to run with just 4,000 full-time employees, far fewer than the 15,000 full-timers and thousands more contractors Yahoo employed then. He said Yahoo EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) would increase by 50 percent if Mayer closed his deals.

Mayer heard him out, taking notes the whole time.

Within 24 hours, Mayer let Heckman know that she’d canceled all his deals and that his services were no longer needed by Yahoo.

Heckman flew to Ibiza, Spain for a 30-day vacation.

Mayer began to hire her own people.

Ironically, one of her biggest hires in her first few months at Yahoo was the Google executive Jim Heckman had been negotiating with, Henrique De Castro.

Mayer made De Castro Yahoo’s COO, and agreed to pay him as much as $62 million over four years, not counting annual stock grants.

This hire came as a surprise to Michael Barrett, the Google executive Ross Levinsohn had hired to run Yahoo ad sales. Though Barrett had been hired by Levinsohn, he was trying to make a go of things at Mayer’s Yahoo.

Barrett had heard rumors that Mayer was going to hire someone to replace him, but when he confronted her about them she said she wasn’t going to hire anyone above him, and certainly not Henrique De Castro. She even hinted that Barrett could be Yahoo’s chief operating officer.

But then Barrett read a story on AllThingsD.com saying that De Castro had been hired.

Hurt, but politic, he called Mayer’s office intending to congratulate her on the big hire. He wanted to begin discussing his own exit, as well.

Barrett got Mayer’s assistant.

She said, “Marissa is unavailable. I’m sure she’d love to hear from you. Could I have her call you back?”

Barrett said fine.

Mayer called him back while he was out to dinner in San Francisco.

As he picked up the phone, he expected her to begin the conversation with an apology for blindsiding him.

But all Mayer said was, “You called?”

Stunned that Mayer would either pretend to not know why he called or actually didn’t know why, Barrett said, “Yeah, I just wanted to say congrats on Henrique. He sounds like a really great hire.”

Mayer said, “I wasn’t able to tell anyone I was hiring him. I don’t think you should feel bad.”

“I don’t really feel bad at all,” he said.

The two never talked again, and Barrett left Yahoo with a severance package worth many millions of dollars.




Henrique De Castro, Google
All Things D

Henrique De Castro's nickname is “the most interesting man in the world,” after the Dos Equis spokesman.

De Castro has a distinct reputation among his former colleagues on the advertising side of Google’s business. All consider him sharp and effective. But he speaks with a heavy accent, is considered deeply pompous, and likes to speak in aphorisms. His nickname is “the most interesting man in the world,” after the Dos Equis spokesman.

Mayer’s next most important and controversial hire was a longtime private equity investor named Jacqueline Reses.

Though Reses had no experience in human resources, Mayer put her in charge of it at Yahoo. Mayer hired Reses because Mayer’s plan to improve the talent level at Yahoo was to buy lots of failed startups for small amounts of money.

Mayer believed that Reses would be expert at nailing down those kinds of transactions. She has been. In Mayer’s first year, Yahoo bought more than 20 startups.

Jackie Reses is Mayer's executive bagman.

Reses, a “gruff” and “matter-of-fact,” executive also served another purpose for Mayer: executioner. In December 2012, she called up Michael Katz, a Yahoo executive based in New York, and asked him out for a drink at a Mexican restaurant called Dos Caminos. It was a Sunday and Katz was celebrating the second night of Hanukkah, but he figured Reses would only ask him out at such an inconvenient time for something important. One drink in, she fired him — just weeks before a multimillion-dollar bonus was due. (He sued.)

Mayer replaced Levinsohn’s chief marketing officer, Mollie Spillman, in August — while Spillman was on vacation. The new CMO was Kathy Savitt, a “bubbly” and “charismatic” executive who’d founded a startup in 2009 after running marketing for teen retail giant American Eagle Outfitters.

After completing the sale of some Alibaba stock back to Alibaba and netting Yahoo almost $8 billion in cash, CFO Tim Morse left the company at the end of September 2012. Mayer hired the plain-spoken Ken Goldman to replace him.

Mayer kept some of Levinsohn’s people in place during her first year. Media boss Mickie Rosen would last until July 2013.

In the middle of all this, a baby

Marissa Mayer and her babyOn Sept. 30, 2012 Mayer gave birth to a baby boy. For weeks, Mayer and Bogue called their child only “BBBB” for “Big Baby Boy Bogue.” They would eventually name him Macallister.

Mayer’s pregnancy had been a fascination of the media, women around the world, and plenty of her Yahoo coworkers. Everyone wondered how she would handle having a newborn while trying to turn around a multibillion-dollar public company.

Mayer made the baby-raising part look easy.

She took just a two-week maternity leave. Then, two months after giving birth, Mayer told the audience at a conference on women in business: “The baby’s been way easier than everyone made it out to be.”

What Mayer didn’t say was that, thanks to her incredible wealth and power at Yahoo, she had a lot of help with Macallister. At home, she had a full-time staff. At Yahoo, she knocked down a wall in her office and set up a nursery so that Macallister — and his nanny — could come to the office with her every day.

The comments upset a lot of women. Lisa Belkin of The Huffington Post wrote an open letter to Mayer, in which she said, “Dear Marissa Mayer … Putting ‘baby’ and ‘easy’ in the same sentence turns you into one of those mothers we don’t like very much.”

Many of the same women would also take issue with Mayer in the spring of 2013, when she banned employees from working from home. Working from home was a convenient way for many of them to continue their careers after giving birth. Why was Mayer taking such a stance against it?

Mayer hadn’t intended to make a statement. She’d only wanted more people in the office at Yahoo. As for fighting for the working conditions of women, Mayer says that she is not a “feminist.” She says she is “blind to gender.”

Mayer goes missing

By the middle of the fall of 2012, a camaraderie developed between all of Mayer’s direct reports, and enthusiasm in the Yahoo workforce was swelling.

This was in part due to a series of cultural reforms Mayer brought to Yahoo almost immediately upon her arrival.

She wanted to recreate the high-energy, high-productivity culture of Google’s early days, when she had been happy working 100-hour weeks as a programmer.

She made the food free and started taking her own lunches in the employee cafeteria. She took down cubicle walls. She joined in on email chains with lower-level employees. She banned BlackBerrys and gave top-of-the-line company smartphones to every employee. She created a forum where employees could complain about issues and suggest solutions. Parking lots that had been empty until 10 a.m. and again after 4 p.m. were suddenly full from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.

On Fridays, Mayer would host a weekly meeting she called “FYI.” All Yahoo employees were invited. She’d go over her plans for the company, that week’s “wins” for Yahoo, and answer questions from the crowd.

Mayer dazzled. She was in her element. It was like she was back at Stanford, teaching fellow undergraduates the material she’d just learned the year before.

“If you go to the Friday meetings, it’s like a Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting,” says one executive who attended them.

“We would take the stage after she would open, so we were standing off the stage, watching the audience. You should have sees the rapture in their eyes. They were like smitten teenagers. It is unbelievable.

“She is deified. The first 50 rows are packed with the engineering team and they’re cheering her on. There is no question that there’s a palpable level of energy and renewed enthusiasm and renewed pride.”

Just a few weeks in, Yahoo employee morale and productivity hit a high not seen in a decade.

There was only one serious complaint from Mayer’s top executives: She never seemed to be around when they needed her. What was she working on all the time?

Mayer demanded all of her staff across the world join the call, so executives from New York, where it was 6 p.m., and Europe, where it was as late as midnight would dial-in too.

Inevitably, Mayer herself would show up at least 45 minutes late. Some calls started so late that Yahoo’s executives in Europe didn’t hang up till 3 a.m. their time.

One of Mayer’s former Google colleagues says the lateness habit is something Mayer picked up during her 13 years at Google.

Even executives hired by Mayer, like CMO Kathy Savitt, felt ignored by her early on.



“Eric, Larry, and Sergey were always late and causing everybody in the organization to be late. They would hold you over, and then you would be late. And then the next meeting would start late and then run late. And then all of the staff in that meeting would be late. It would just trickle down through the organization. Is Marissa Mayer always late? Well, yeah. But it was endemic to the organization.”

Mayer’s lateness was a pain, sure. But by the early fall of 2012, Mayer’s staff had grown used to it. In fact, they were actually glad when she’d show up late to a meeting, because that meant at least she hadn’t blown it off entirely.

Mayer had approximately 25 people reporting directly to her during her first year at Yahoo. In theory, she was keeping up with each of them in a regularly scheduled weekly meeting. In practice, she would go weeks without talking to people because she was so busy.

For a while, each of those 25 people thought that Mayer was just picking on them, individually. The people who had been at Yahoo before Mayer joined assumed that this meant she was going to fire them soon. The people Mayer had just hired into the company, including Reses and Savitt, were even more puzzled. Why had they been hired only to be ignored?

But then, during one of those long waiting periods after 3 p.m. on a Monday, a conversation unfurled that revealed all.

Making small talk, one executive said to another: “Did she cancel one of your one-on-ones again?”

A third jumped in: “Oh my god, she does that to you too?”

It turned out that everyone in the room and on the call had been canceled on by Mayer, frequently.

“Everyone assumed that they were the only one being canceled on. But then they realized that they weren’t,” says one person who was in those meetings.

The problem with Mayer canceling her scheduled meetings with everyone is that it was otherwise impossible to see her.

“That was your only point of contact with her. There wasn’t a lot of serendipity of bumping into her or having her pop her head into a meeting. Getting onto her calendar was nothing short of impossible.”

One person who kept getting blown off by Mayer remembers thinking: “I may not be you, but I'm running a huge part of your business. I've got thousands of people reporting to me. The chance that I would miss a meeting with my directs without an explanation is none.

“First of all, I don’t miss those meetings. Maybe it happens once in a year because of something. But then I'm going to pick up the phone and I'm going to call them and I'm going to apologize and I'm going to say I'm sorry, I'll make it up to you, let’s schedule some other time. I'm not going to make them wait for more than five minutes because I know they have incredibly important things to do. And they are human beings.”

During those staff meetings, Mayer made little time for certain topics early on — especially those having to do with revenue, advertising technology, or distribution.

Mayer would only entertain three deals per week, and it was quickly obvious the ones she would always prefer to talk about: anything to do with product. If Reses wanted to talk about an aqui-hire that would bring a talented product manager into Yahoo, Mayer would prioritize the conversation. If there was talk of a partnership with Apple on a new Weather app, that would definitely be discussed.

There was a reason for Mayer’s lateness, for the skipped meetings, and for the priority of product discussions during those meetings, though.

Prior to joining Yahoo, Mayer had decided the company’s many problems boiled down to one: everything going out the front door from PR to marketing to products was flawed. In her first months at the company, Mayer’s plan was to immediately stop that from happening ever again.

It would take an incredible amount of time and effort. Picture a dam sprouting leaks, and Mayer trying to plug them with all her fingers and toes.

“Who is this woman and what is she actually saying?”

A week after Mayer joined Yahoo, a Yahoo employee took a photo of one of the purple-on-purple Marissa Mayer HOPE posters taped to the walls of Yahoo and sent it to a Google employee named Hunter Walk.

Walk tweeted it, and soon the poster was a news story.

One of Mayer’s former subordinates from Google, Katie Jacobs Stanton, by then a vice president at Twitter, saw the tweet, and replied to Walk in her own public tweet. She wrote: “I hope that went through UI review :)”

The joke is a reference to the user-interface reviews that Mayer famously insisted on conducting for every consumer-facing Web product Google launched from 2005 to 2010 before she was removed from the top of the search products organization.

Stanton was suggesting that the Mayer she knew, the one she once reported to, would soon have strict control over all of Yahoo, and especially anything Yahoo made for the public’s consumption.

Stanton was spot on.

Upon taking control of Yahoo, Mayer’s first instinct was to survey and quantify everything that Yahoo was doing that the public could see, and then start controlling it.

This applied to all areas of Yahoo, including public relations. Throughout the fall, every week, all the Yahoo PR people had to complete a big spreadsheet with the names of every reporter they wanted to talk to and what the business objective was. This spreadsheet was then submitted to the head of Yahoo PR, Anne Espiritu. Espiritu would then submit the form to Mayer. Mayer, in turn, would approve or reject every call or email and then pass the form back down the line.

If Yahoo’s public relations staff had any complaints about these tactics, they could bring them to Espiritu during her weekly office hours.

No group had a shorter leash than Yahoo’s largest, most important team: the hundreds of people in charge of creating, developing, designing, and updating Yahoo products.

On Tuesday, Dec. 11, 2012, Marissa Mayer wrote a blog post announcing a new version of Yahoo Mail for the Web, Windows 8, the iPhone, and Android.

It was a huge moment for the new Yahoo. No Yahoo product, perhaps other than the Yahoo home page, is as important to Yahoo as Yahoo Mail. It’s the biggest reason any of Yahoo’s 700 million users ever bother to go to Yahoo.com in the first place. And over the previous few years, it had slowly been losing users.

“Email is the ultimate daily habit,” Mayer says in the post. “It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed.”

Three months before those words hit the Web, Mayer and 30 designers, product managers, and engineers sat around a huge table in one of Yahoo’s large, traditional conference rooms.

Mayer was talking. Fast. As she spoke, two of the people seated near her typed away like crazy, trying to take verbatim notes in Google Docs. They were struggling to keep up.

This group of people had been meeting three times a week for a month, and they’d turned the conference room into a space that now looked more like a design studio. Windows ran down one side of the room. On the other side, projectors hung from the ceiling, rendering screens on the wall. Between the projections stood 20 or 30 huge pieces of foam core pinned up with a collection of ideas about what a new Yahoo home page and a new Yahoo email could look like.

For the 30 people sitting around the table, their first meetings with Mayer over the past month had been terrifying.

For years, Yahoo had been a place where the CEO was a distant figure who would meet with various members of his or her executive leadership team to lay out broad strategies for each function: design, technology, product, etc.

Mayer skipped all that.

“She was like ‘yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll get to that. Let’s first get some stuff out the door that actually works,’” says a witness to those early days.

It was a level of energized scrutiny none of them were used to.

Mayer came at them with “a voracious flood of possibilities” about what the new products could look like. Her ideas were both big and small — minute even. Mayer displayed such a “profound capacity for detail,” that the leadership in the room finally set up the two transcribers so that later they could “share and dissect” all of Mayer’s ideas and decisions.

One of them remembers thinking: “Who is this woman and what is she actually saying?”

But soon, as the weeks wore on, the 30 people in that room began to learn how to respond to what Mayer was saying.

Some of the people in the room were growing frustrated with the pace, but others began contributing. Among those who contributed, Mayer learned who to trust. Those trusted people began to grow in confidence and they started to contribute even more.

Soon, these once-terrifying meetings became friendly, fun. Jokes started to fly around.

“It warmed up,” says someone who was in those meetings. “Once we learned how to operate on that level of intensity with her, she softened and it became more of an interaction.”

“You’d look at her and she’s smiling!”

This was Mayer in her ultimate element.

She was pushing the pace as she had those late nights working on problems for Philosophy 160A. She was teaching, as she had 3,000 Stanford undergraduates. She was creating, as she had those pompom routines 25 years before. She was using data to empathize with hundreds of millions of people all at once, as she had learned to do at Google.

“I've never seen anybody like [her],” says someone from those meetings. Mayer, he says, was “somebody who could see a whole collection of possibilities and could just talk about her experiences and principles.”

“In that way she would start to not only share how she was thinking, but also help us learn a lens to look through to be able to connect where she was coming from and what we were about.”

Yahoo MailMayer’s intensity was contagious. By November, the Yahoo Mail team was working nights and weekends, racing to finish by an insane early December deadline. This was a credit to Mayer and the leader of the Mail team, Shashi Seth, a product leader Mayer inherited.

Finally, the Mail team finished their work at the end of November. They were proud of their work, and they deserved to be. Never had Yahoo built and launched a version of Mail so quickly. The last time Yahoo had done it, it took 18 months to build the product and another six months to roll it out.

But then Yahoo learned another lesson about what making products would be like with Marissa Mayer as CEO.

One day before the new Yahoo Mail was set to launch, Mayer called a meeting with CMO Kathy Savitt, Shashi Seth, and the entire product and engineering leadership team — about 10 people in total. They met in Phish Food, the conference room where months before, Ross Levinsohn had pitched an alternate reality for Yahoo to a board that wasn’t really listening.

Everyone settled in; Mayer dropped a bombshell. For months, it had been decided that the new Yahoo Mail’s colors would be blue and gray. The thought was that users were going to be looking at Yahoo Mail on their phones all day long, and so it was best to choose the most subtly contrasting colors possible.

Mayer wanted to change the colors entirely — from blue and gray to purple and yellow.

Seth’s body language shifted immediately. He looked deflated. He was going to have to tell his people the news.

Changing the color of a product like Yahoo Mail sounds easy, but it’s not. Mayer’s decision meant that some unlucky group of people were going to have to manually go and change the color in literally thousands of places — all while working under a deadline.

Seth’s team got the changes done, but there was fallout from Mayer’s decision. The lead Yahoo Mail designer quit and went to Google. The Yahoo Mail product manager went to Disney. The lead engineer left and founded a startup. Seth himself left Yahoo in January 2013, a month after Mail launched.

One person, frustrated by the incident, says he’d hoped the Yahoo Mail launch would make people “incredibly proud of what they've accomplished” and that they would be inspired to “stick around for years to come.”

“It was the exact opposite,” he says.

But others have a different perspective.

Their view is that Mayer refused to launch a product that she didn’t think was finished. A product’s color may seem superficial, but Mayer is obsessed with data that shows it is not. At Yahoo’s scale, if you can change a color a little bit and affect the performance by some factor of 0.01 percent, that translates into millions of dollars.

In this view, when Mayer forced already burnt-out people to work even harder at the very last minute to make sure a product went out as good as it could be, she set a marker for the new era of Yahoo.

“The precedent made the next project easier to deal with,” says one person who helped launch Yahoo Mail. “We’d gotten comfortable with what Yahoo-ness was about.”




Adam Cahan
Mayer put Adam Cahan in charge of a new group called “Mobile and Emerging Products.”

Yahoo's mobile problem
When Mayer came to Yahoo in 2012, Yahoo’s mobile traffic was still tiny compared to other big tech companies like Google and Facebook. Yahoo’s mobile apps weren’t very popular either.

So when Mayer joined Yahoo, she knew that a top priority had to be developing mobile apps that consumers would make a part of their daily lives.

To try to figure out what those apps should be, Mayer conducted a survey.

The results made her laugh.

She learned that after activities like calling people, texting, and maps, the main things people do on their phones everyday are: check email, check weather, get news, get stock quotes, check sports scores, get entertainment news, share photos, communicate with groups, and ask questions.

What made Mayer laugh was that those are all things people go to Yahoo for on the Web. Yahoo’s biggest products are Yahoo Mail, Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports, and so on.

At a speech in New York in May 2013, Mayer said: “Yahoo has had the functionality and content people want on their phones. Now we need to get it into apps and the mobile web in a way people can really consume it on their phones.”

In her first year at Yahoo, Mayer made two big moves to expand mobile reach and usage.

The first move was to put a Yahoo executive named Adam Cahan in charge of a new group called “Mobile and Emerging Products.” Cahan came to Yahoo when it acquired his mobile startup, IntoNow, for $20 million in 2011.

Yahoo lacked the mobile talent to staff such a group, so Mayer spent $200 million at the end of 2012 and through August 2013 acquiring more than 20 mobile startups. In almost every case, Yahoo would shut down the startup’s product, sign its engineering and product development people to two- and four-year contracts, and integrate them into Cahan’s team.

Mayer’s second big move to improve Yahoo’s standing in mobile would turn out to be the biggest transaction of her entire career. It would cost Yahoo $1.1 billion.

Could Mayer close the deal?

On the evening of Thursday, May 16, 2013, 26-year-old David Karp looked at his iPhone and saw he had a voice mail from the chief operating officer of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg.

David Karp, founder and CEO of Tumblr.



He listened to her message. All Sandberg said was that she’d like Karp to call her back.

But she had said enough.

Karp, the founder of a blog network called Tumblr, told his investment banker Jonathan Turner at Qatalyst Partners about the voice mail.

They decided they had to call Yahoo and let them know Sandberg had called.

That day, All Things D reporter Kara Swisher and her colleague Peter Kafka had reported that Yahoo was in serious talks to buy Tumblr.

Karp, his board, and his bankers believed Sandberg was calling to see if the report was true, and if Facebook could possibly join the bidding for Tumblr.

On the one hand, a bidding war between Facebook and Yahoo would be great news for Tumblr, its bankers, and its investors.

On the other, Turner was terrified that the leak would spoil their deal. Mayer was from Google, and Google was infamous for pulling the plug on deals if it felt like the other side was trying to gin up interest in the press. Throughout every stage of the slow courtship between the companies, Turner had been paranoid about the press.

When Sheryl Sandberg left a voicemail on David Karp's phone, it threatened to blow up the deal.

After originally offering only $800 million to buy Tumblr, Yahoo had finally upped its bid to $1.1 billion and was going through the final stages of due diligence. The deal was basically done, and the Tumblr board didn’t think it was time to get greedy.

Still, Yahoo had to be told about the voice mail. The companies had signed an “exclusivity” agreement, which meant that Tumblr had to notify Yahoo of any other approaches.

Turner had nothing to worry about.

When Mayer found out about Sandberg’s voice mail, she only became more eager to get the deal done.

She went to her M&A team, led by “gruff” New Yorker Jackie Reses, and told them to hurry up and wrap things up; she didn’t want to lose out on Tumblr — not after all those months of work and so many meetings with Karp.

Talks between the two companies had begun in November 2012, when Karp went to Sunnyvale and met with Mayer.

By then, Tumblr, founded in 2007, had grown to an astounding 200 million worldwide users a month, but Karp still hadn’t figured out how the blog network could make a lot of money off all those users.

He was taking meetings on the West Coast to see if Google, Facebook, Microsoft, or Yahoo wanted to make a strategic investment. He thought one of those companies might want to sell ads on Tumblr.com and split the revenues.

That first meeting between Karp and Mayer left both parties cold. Mayer mostly talked about what she was trying to do at Yahoo, and a potential deal between the two companies didn’t really come up.

After the meeting, Karp told his board and his bankers that the new CEO of Yahoo was very nice, but that he didn’t see a deal happening.

At investment bank Qatalyst, Turner passed the news onto his boss, legendary tech banker Frank Quattrone.

Quattrone had gotten rich and powerful during the dot-com bubble. He also got in some hot water with the law, though he eventually extricated himself. He’s brash. He’s got a mustache. He looks like the cartoon version of a deal-making, back-slapping, investment banker. And yet, he’s probably the best deal-maker in the business.

Quattrone thought he would be able to get Mayer more interested in Tumblr. So, in early 2013, he met with her, and pointed out that one of Tumblr’s great strengths was how popular it was on mobile devices. He accurately noted the incredible amount of time young people were spending on Tumblr.

Quattrone had said the magic word: “mobile.”

Mayer said she’d take a second look.

When Marissa Mayer studies a topic, she doesn’t do it superficially. After her meeting with Quattrone, she spent an entire weekend using Tumblr, poking around the site, and studying metrics.

Mayer decided to get back in touch with Karp. Only, she didn’t want to do an advertising deal or make a strategic investment. She wanted to buy his company.

If that was going to happen, it was going to take some doing. Karp didn’t want to sell his company. Facebook and Google had started trying to talk him into it, but he refused, even though a sale would net him more than $100 million after taxes. He wanted to keep control over his company.

“She really took ownership of this, really persuaded David that she would let Tumblr stay independent.”



Mayer realized she needed to put on a full-court press.

Mayer flew to New York in February and had dinner with Karp and Jackie Reses on a Saturday night. Mayer was able to win Karp over that night. She said that Tumblr was an excellent product — an amazing tool for self-expression. She noted that it was beating Facebook with younger consumers.

That Saturday night, Mayer told Karp that she had a board meeting coming up soon, and that she’d like to bring up the possibility of buying Tumblr.

Would he be able to meet again that Sunday?

Karp agreed to meet again. That Sunday night over dinner, Mayer talked about how the new paradigm for tech acquisitions was for the acquiring company to allow the acquired company to continue operating independently, as a subsidiary with its own brand. She said that’s what Google had done with YouTube, what Facebook had done with Instagram, and it’s what Yahoo would do with Tumblr.

They stayed out till 2 a.m. Karp told Mayer to bring up the idea at her board meeting.

During her first-quarter board meeting, Mayer said she’d like to buy Tumblr. She said Tumblr would, in a snap, improve Yahoo’s position in mobile and make its overall audience much younger. The board gave her full support to pursue the deal.

Everything went fine from there. The All Things D report and Sandberg’s voice mail only hurried the process along.

Finally, over the next weekend, Karp and his board accepted Yahoo’s offer.

It was a triumph for Mayer and Yahoo.

For years, Yahoo had tried to acquire hot startups that would help it become more popular with users, and eventually begin growing its revenues again. But time and again, the entrepreneurial ambitious types running hot startups would refuse to sell to Yahoo, preferring to sell to Google or Facebook.

For Mayer, the deal showed how far she’d come as an executive. Her penchant for teacherly mentoring allowed her to cultivate a relationship with Karp and close a deal that had seemed impossible.

One source close to Tumblr’s now defunct board said he was blown away by how much effort Mayer put into the deal.

“Where I give her high marks is that you don’t typically get CEOs that engaged.”

“She really took ownership of this, really persuaded David that she would let Tumblr stay independent.

“She turned David around. He was very reluctant. He’s not motivated by money in the same way as the rest of us. He’s really passionate about the product. His concern about selling to Yahoo was that it would get subsumed.

“Marissa convinced David that this wasn’t the old Yahoo and that she’s going to run it differently.”




Epilogue_02

Now into her second year as Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer from Wausau, Wisc., says “I’m having the time of my life.”

A natural teacher, she has, in her 20s and 30s, turned that skill into the ability to inspire thousands of people to make technology products that millions of people use.

The challenge she’ll face in her 40s is: Can she become the rare, complete technology CEO who can create magical products and deliver financial results?

By one measure, Mayer did incredibly well during her first year. Since David Filo unrolled the purple carpet for Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s stock has gone from $15.74 per share to hovering around $28 in August 2013.

But, while investor confidence in Mayer’s vision and performance so far certainly plays some role in the stock’s magnificent surge, a much greater factor has been Alibaba, the Chinese Internet company in which Yahoo is a part-owner.

Yahoo has benefited from Alibaba in two ways.

In the months before Mayer joined Yahoo, CEO Scott Thompson and CFO Tim Morse hammered out a deal in which Alibaba bought back a small portion of Yahoo’s stake for $7.6 billion. When he was still CEO, Thompson signaled that he would use that money to buy back Yahoo shares, driving up their price. When she took over, Mayer went along with this plan.

Because of Alibaba, Yahoo has been able to spend billions of dollars buying its own stock. With the supply of shares shrinking, and a few billion dollars-worth of demand in the market, the shares have naturally risen.

The other way Alibaba has helped Yahoo shares grow in value is by growing in value itself.

Alibaba has yet to go public. Because Yahoo still owns a large stake in Alibaba, it is actually one of the few ways investors are able to place bets on it. Those bets even have a pay-off date. As a part of the deal Thompson and Morse negotiated, Yahoo will sell even more stock when Alibaba does finally IPO. Some analysts think Yahoo will get another $7 billion in cash out of that deal.

Another reason to be skeptical of Mayer’s performance is that the person more responsible than anyone else for her being the CEO of Yahoo, Third Point’s Dan Loeb, sold off most of his holdings in the company in July 2013. That month, he, Michael Wolf, and Harry Wilson resigned from Yahoo’s board, as their settlement with the board required them to do if Third Point’s stake in Yahoo ever fell below 2 percent.

Third Point remains a major Yahoo shareholder, but Loeb’s liquidation is still a strong signal that he thinks the upside from where Yahoo is now is more limited than it was in 2012.

All that said, there is no question that Mayer has drastically improved Yahoo in her short time there so far.

You can see it in the metrics. Yahoo claims that after Mayer’s redesigns, traffic to apps for Yahoo Mail is up 120 percent; Yahoo Weather, 150 percent; and Yahoo News, 55 percent. In her first year, Mayer was able to keep traffic to Yahoo Mail on the Web flat, and even slightly grow Yahoo.com. In an age where big websites usually shrink because people check their email and news on their phones, that’s remarkable. In the middle of August 2013, ComScore reported that Yahoo Web properties had passed Google properties as the most popular in the United States.

Beyond the metrics though, Mayer has revolutionized the culture at Yahoo.

One Yahoo executive told me that before Mayer arrived, “what was missing was leadership from the very top, which was able to cut to the chase and get some tough decisions made, get focused in the right places, get the sense of urgency, and also somebody who could really be the chief quality control leader of the company.”

And indeed, the quality of Yahoo products has gone up since Mayer arrived. The Yahoo Weather app that launched for iPhone in 2013 is stunning. Mayer’s redesign of Flickr is a delight.

Yes, some people don’t get along with her because of her direct, all-business style.

Sometimes her brusque manner comes off as rude, “demeaning,” or “stuck up.” It can insult people.

But even some of those people say Yahoo has become a far more vibrant place under her leadership.

One person Mayer frequently clashed with at Yahoo told me, “You have to give Marissa a lot of credit. Just because I don’t like what she’s done to me and I don’t like what she’s done to many other people, doesn’t mean I'm going to shy away from giving her credit. She brought life back to Yahoo. There’s no question about it.

“The Friday before she came on, the parking lots would be empty till 10 a.m. and would be empty again after 4 p.m. That happened day after day after day for seven months in a row. Marissa comes, the next week, the parking lots are full at 8 a.m. and people are still there at 6:30.

“The changes that she brought — making food free, focusing on quality, shutting some things down, being open and honest during the Friday FYI meetings — all brought belief back for a lot of people.”

“If she hadn’t come in, all the smart people would have left.

“And that would have been the end of Yahoo.”

A note on sources

═══

This story is based primarily on first-hand reporting consisting of dozens of interviews.

This story would not exist if not for the cooperation of many people who did speak with me, including those who grew up with Mayer, taught her, or worked with her at Google and Yahoo. Some of these people are or were employed at Yahoo and spoke to me at the risk of their careers. Many of these people spoke on a not-for-attribution basis. Some spoke on the record. I have not identified many on-the-record sources because I did not want to allow for the process of elimination to identify others.

This story, being told in a narrative fashion, does not identify the sources of information for particular facts, including thoughts. I would caution readers against assuming that because I have reported a person’s thoughts, that person is a direct source. A person will often share thoughts about pivotal moments in their lives with a large group of people.

As a part of the narrative, my story includes dialogue.

I am grateful to James B. Stewart’s “note on sources” at the end of his book, “DisneyWar.” That note helped me think about how to describe my own sourcing. In his note, Stewart describes how he sources dialogue. It’s a perfect explanation, and I’d like to quote it and use it as my own explanation.

“As part of the narrative, I have included passages of dialogue. Dialogue— what words were said— is a fact like any other. It is not necessarily a quotation from an interview with me and I would discourage readers from inferring that one or both of the speakers is a direct source. Especially in today’s world of instant communication, it is sometimes amazing how many people turn out to be privy to what others may assume is a private conversation. Many of the conversations reported in this book either took place before an audience or became known to a wide circle of people, often within minutes of their taking place. … In a few cases other people were listening in on speakerphones, extensions, or overheard conversations without one or both of the speakers’ knowledge. Readers should bear in mind that, given the vagaries of human memory, remembered dialogue is rarely the same as actual recordings and transcripts. At the same time, it is no more nor less accurate than many other recollections.”

 Awesome article Nick. My 2c on the demotion, not sure if it is accurate: When Bing launched it was a bit of a wake up call to Google since objectively it was better at search across a number of dimensions, specifically image search and vertical search in health and travel. At Google search had been stagnating at that time, and vertical search in particular was considered an unexciting area for investment. I've got to believe that these factors played a role in tarnishing her image at the company since it put the core into jeopardy.

 One of the better articles I have read about technology executives, and i have read thousands. Beautifully develops the foundational components of her personality, and then objectively assesses the arc of her career, with appropriate highlighting. My high school senior is devouring the article, and hopefully she draws inspiration from a talented and driven Marissa.

 Great writing Nicholas! This is BusinessInsider at its best. I read EVERY word, didn't skip ahead. That is great writing.
 Marissa is a special person. I am a huge fan. She always had time for me as a low level Googler, and even when I worked for Microsoft. I was surprised at the "robot" characterization by people who have worked with her, but perhaps that was a reaction to the way she juggles hundreds of balls at a time. That has not been my experience.

 Yahoo is lucky to have Marissa as CEO. She has done what none of the previous CEOs could do. She has inspired Yahoo employees, given them confidence, and convinced the stock market she has a winning plan. More than anything Yahoo had a crisis of confidence. Marissa has fixed that. No one else could.

 Henry, give Nicholas a raise, and give him the time to write more stories like this. This is quality journalism that will attract readers and advertisers.

 Thank you for a well-written, balanced article. There is so much lionizing and vilifying of this woman in the press that it's hard to separate fact from fiction. What I enjoyed, particularly, about this narrative is how it provides coherence and causality rather than the jigsawing together a bunch of provocative cliches and soundbites.

 I don't want to reduce this story to a gender thing - no one's life is just about their gender, of course. But, I know many women in the tech world like the Mayer described here, especially in her earlier days - focused, driven, very smart, uncompromising, with a greater cognitive capacity than most around her and a visionary who can see both the big picture and the little details. This isn't to say that some men are not all of these things as well. Nor does it mean that these women are perfect in every way. But, somehow, it seems that we are not evolved enough yet in the world of business / tech, to give these women the same amount of leeway that we give to similar men. For example, I wonder if Scott Thompson or Ross Levinsohn, who were likely not perfect when leading Yahoo, got as much press or critiquing about their leadership / management styles. I don't recall much at all.

Nearly half a century ago, when Elvis Presley was filming “Harum Scarum” and “Help!” was on the charts, a moody, father-haunted, yet uncannily charismatic Shore rat named Bruce Springsteen was building a small reputation around central Jersey as a guitar player in a band called the Castiles. The band was named for the lead singer’s favorite brand of soap. Its members were from Freehold, an industrial town half an hour inland from the boardwalk carnies and the sea. The Castiles performed at sweet sixteens and Elks-club dances, at drive-in movie theatres and ShopRite ribbon cuttings, at a mobile-home park in Farmingdale, at the Matawan-Keyport Rollerdrome. Once, they played for the patients at a psychiatric hospital, in Marlboro. A gentleman dressed in a suit came to the stage and, in an introductory speech that ran some twenty minutes, declared the Castiles “greater than the Beatles.” At which point a doctor intervened and escorted him back to his room.

One spring afternoon in 1966, the Castiles, with dreams of making it big and making it quick, drove to a studio at the Brick Mall Shopping Center and recorded two original songs, “Baby I” and “That’s What You Get.” Mainly, though, they played an array of covers, from Glenn Miller’s “In the Mood” to the G-Clefs’ “I Understand.” They did Sonny and Cher, Sam and Dave, Don & Juan, the Who, the Kinks, the Stones, the Animals.

Many musicians in their grizzled late maturity have an uncertain grasp on their earliest days on the bandstand. (Not a few have an uncertain grasp on last week.) But Springsteen, who is sixty-two and among the most durable musicians since B. B. King and Om Kalthoum, seems to remember every gaudy night, from the moment, in 1957, when he and his mother watched Elvis on “The Ed Sullivan Show”—“I looked at her and I said, ‘I wanna be just . . . like . . . that’ ”—to his most recent exploits as a multimillionaire populist rock star crowd-surfing the adoring masses. These days, he is the subject of historical exhibitions; at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum, in Cleveland, and at the National Constitution Center, in Philadelphia, his lyric sheets, old cars, and faded performing duds have been displayed like the snippets of the Shroud. But, unlike the Rolling Stones, say, who have not written a great song since the disco era and come together only to pad their fortunes as their own cover band, Springsteen refuses to be a mercenary curator of his past. He continues to evolve as an artist, filling one spiral notebook after another with ideas, quotations, questions, clippings, and, ultimately, new songs. His latest album, “Wrecking Ball,” is a melodic indictment of the recessionary moment, of income disparity, emasculated workers, and what he calls “the distance between the American reality and the American dream.” The work is remote from his early operettas of humid summer interludes and abandon out on the Turnpike. In his desire to extend a counter-tradition of political progressivism, Springsteen quotes from Irish rebel songs, Dust Bowl ballads, Civil War tunes, and chain-gang chants.

Early this year, Springsteen was leading rehearsals for a world tour at Fort Monmouth, an Army base that was shut down last year; it had been an outpost since the First World War of military communications and intelligence, and once employed Julius Rosenberg and thousands of militarized carrier pigeons. The twelve-hundred-acre property is now a ghost town inhabited only by steel dummies meant to scare off the ubiquitous Canada geese that squirt a carpet of green across middle Jersey. Driving to the far end of the base, I reached an unlovely theatre that Springsteen and Jon Landau, his longtime manager, had rented for the rehearsals. Springsteen had performed for officers’ children at the Fort Monmouth “teen club” (dancing, no liquor) with the Castiles, forty-seven years earlier.

The atmosphere inside was purposeful but easygoing. Musicians stood onstage noodling on their instruments with the languid air of outfielders warming up in the sun. Max Weinberg, the band’s volcanic drummer, wore the sort of generous jeans favored by dads at weekend barbecues. Steve Van Zandt, Springsteen’s childhood friend and guitarist-wingman, keeps up a brutal schedule as an actor and a d.j., and he seemed weary, his eyes drooping under a piratical purple head scarf. The bass player Garry Tallent, the organist Charlie Giordano, and the pianist Roy Bittan horsed around on a roller-rink tune while they waited. The guitarist Nils Lofgren was on the phone, trying to figure out flights to get back to his home, in Scottsdale, for the weekend.

Springsteen arrived and greeted everyone with a quick hello and his distinctive cackle. He is five-nine and walks with a rolling rodeo gait. When he takes in something new—a visitor, a thought, a passing car in the distance—his eyes narrow, as if in hard light, and his lower jaw protrudes a bit. His hairline is receding, and, if one had to guess, he has, over the years, in the face of high-def scrutiny and the fight against time, enjoined the expensive attentions of cosmetic and dental practitioners. He remains dispiritingly handsome, preposterously fit. (“He has practically the same waist size as when I met him, when we were fifteen,” says Steve Van Zandt, who does not.) Some of this has to do with his abstemious inclinations; Van Zandt says Springsteen is “the only guy I know—I think the only guy I know at all—who never did drugs.” He’s followed more or less the same exercise regimen for thirty years: he runs on a treadmill and, with a trainer, works out with weights. It has paid off. His muscle tone approximates a fresh tennis ball. And yet, with the tour a month away, he laughed at the idea that he was ready. “I’m not remotely close,” he said, slumping into a chair twenty rows back from the stage.

Preparing for a tour is a process far more involved than middle-aged workouts designed to stave off premature infarction. “Think of it this way: performing is like sprinting while screaming for three, four minutes,” Springsteen said. “And then you do it again. And then you do it again. And then you walk a little, shouting the whole time. And so on. Your adrenaline quickly overwhelms your conditioning.” His style in performance is joyously demonic, as close as a white man of Social Security age can get to James Brown circa 1962 without risking a herniated disk or a shattered pelvis. Concerts last in excess of three hours, without a break, and he is constantly dancing, screaming, imploring, mugging, kicking, windmilling, crowd-surfing, climbing a drum riser, jumping on an amp, leaping off Roy Bittan’s piano. The display of energy and its depletion is part of what is expected of him. In return, the crowd participates in a display of communal adoration. Like pilgrims at a gigantic outdoor Mass—think John Paul II at Gdansk—they know their role: when to raise their hands, when to sway, when to sing, when to scream his name, when to bear his body, hand over hand, from the rear of the orchestra to the stage. (Van Zandt: “Messianic? Is that the word you’re looking for?”)

Springsteen came to glory in the age of Letterman, but he is anti-ironical. Keith Richards works at seeming not to give a shit. He makes you wonder if it is harder to play the riffs for “Street Fighting Man” or to dangle a cigarette from his lips by a single thread of spit. Springsteen is the opposite. He is all about flagrant exertion. There always comes a moment in a Springsteen concert, as there always did with James Brown, when he plays out a dumb show of the conflict between exhaustion and the urge to go on. Brown enacted it by dropping to his knees, awash in sweat, unable to dance another step, yet shooing away his cape bearer, the aide who would enrobe him and hustle him offstage. Springsteen slumps against the mike stand, spent and still, then, regaining consciousness, shakes off the sweat—No! It can’t be!—and calls on the band for another verse, another song. He leaves the stage soaked, as if he had swum around the arena in his clothes while being chased by barracudas. “I want an extreme experience,” he says. He wants his audience to leave the arena, as he commands them, “with your hands hurting, your feet hurting, your back hurting, your voice sore, and your sexual organs stimulated!”

So the display of exuberance is critical. “For an adult, the world is constantly trying to clamp down on itself,” he says. “Routine, responsibility, decay of institutions, corruption: this is all the world closing in. Music, when it’s really great, pries that shit back open and lets people back in, it lets light in, and air in, and energy in, and sends people home with that and sends me back to the hotel with it. People carry that with them sometimes for a very long period of time.”

The band rehearses not so much to learn how to play particular songs as to see what songs work with other songs, to figure out a basic set list (with countless alternatives) that will fill all of Springsteen’s demands: to air the new work and his latest themes; to play the expected hits for the casual fans; to work up enough surprises and rarities for fans who have seen him hundreds of times; and, especially, to pace the show from frenzy to calm and back again. In the past several years, Springsteen has been taking requests from the crowd. He has never been stumped. “You can take the band out of the bar, but you can’t take the bar out of the band,” Van Zandt says.

The E Street Band members are not Springsteen’s equals. “This is not the Beatles,” as Weinberg puts it. They are salaried musicians; in 1989, they were fired en masse. They await his call to record, to tour, to rehearse. And so when Springsteen sprang out of his chair and said, “O.K., time to work,” they straightened up and watched for his cue.

Huh . . . two . . . three . . . four.

As the anthemic opener, “We Take Care of Our Own,” washed over the empty seats, I stood at the back of the hall next to the sound engineer, John Cooper, a rangy, unflappable Hoosier, who was monitoring a vast soundboard and a series of laptops. One hard drive contains the lyrics and keys for hundreds of songs, so that when Springsteen calls for something off the cuff the song quickly appears on TelePrompters within sight of him and his bandmates. (The crutch is hardly unique—Sinatra, in late career, used a TelePrompter, and so do the Stones and many other bands.) Although more than half the show will be the same from night to night, the rest is up for grabs.

“This is about the only live music left, with a few exceptions,” Cooper said. Lip-synchers are legion. Coldplay thickens its sound with heaps of pre-taped instruments and synthesizers. The one artificial sound in Springsteen’s act is a snare-drum sound in “We Take Care of Our Own” that seemed to elude easy reproduction.

That afternoon at Fort Monmouth, Springsteen was intent on nailing “the opening four,” the first songs, which come rapid fire. The band and the crew gave particular attention to those lingering seconds between songs when the keys modulate and the guitar techs pass different instruments to the musicians. It is intricate work; the technicians have to move with the precision of a Daytona pit crew.

Before the tour officially began, in Atlanta, there were a few smaller venues to play, including the Apollo Theatre, in Harlem. There are usually more African-Americans onstage than in the seats, but Springsteen is steeped in black music, and he was especially eager to play the date in Harlem. “All of our teachers stood on those boards at the Apollo,” he said. “The essence of the way this band moves is one of soul. It’s supposed to be overwhelming. You shouldn’t be able to catch your breath. That’s what being a front man is all about—the idea of having something supple underneath you, that machine that roars and can turn on a dime.”

Rock tours generally have a theme: a band’s coltish arrival, a new style or look, a reunion, a new set of songs, a political moment. Springsteen was salting the show with the political material from “Wrecking Ball,” but the most vivid theme on this tour was to be time passing, age, death, and, if Springsteen could manage it, a sense of renewal. The surviving core of the band—Van Zandt, Tallent, Weinberg, Bittan, and Springsteen—had been playing together since the Ford Administration; Lofgren and Patti Scialfa, Springsteen’s wife, who is a singer and guitar player, joined in the eighties.

The run of tragedy, debility, and erosion has seemed relentless in recent years. Nils Lofgren has had both hips replaced, and both his shoulders are a wreck. Max Weinberg has endured open-heart surgery, prostate-cancer treatment, two failed back operations, and seven hand operations. The morning after a concert, he told me, he feels like the Nick Nolte character in the football movie “North Dallas Forty”: bruised and barely able to move. Lofgren has compared the backstage area to “a MASH unit,” with ice packs, heating pads, Bengay tubes, and masseuses on call. More alarmingly, Jon Landau, Springsteen’s manager and closest friend, was recovering from brain surgery.

There have been deeper, permanent losses. In 2008, Danny Federici, who played organ and accordion with Springsteen for forty years, died of melanoma. Springsteen’s body man on tour, a Special Forces veteran named Terry Magovern, died the year before. Springsteen’s trainer died at the age of forty.

The most shocking loss came last year, when Clarence Clemons, Springsteen’s saxophone player and onstage foil and protector, died of a stroke. Clemons was a colossus—six-four, a former football player. As a musician, he possessed a raspy tone reminiscent of King Curtis. He was not a great improviser, but his solos, painstakingly scripted over long hours in the studio with Springsteen, were set pieces in every show. Then, there was his sheer stage presence. Clemons gave Springsteen a mythic companion who embodied the fraternal spirit of the band. “Standing next to Clarence was like standing next to the baddest ass on the planet,” Springsteen said of him in tribute. “You felt like no matter what the day or the night brought, nothing was going to touch you.”

Clemons’s life style was considerably less disciplined than Springsteen’s, and, in recent years, his body had been breaking down, requiring hip replacements, knee replacements, back surgery. On the last tour, Clemons was driven around the arena tunnels in a golf cart. Onstage, he was spending less time exerting himself on the horn and more time resting on a stool and banging on a tambourine. When he did play, it was clear that he was losing the high notes. After one of his last concerts, he told a friend, “I deserve a God-damned Academy Award.” He said that he felt like Mickey Rourke’s character in “The Wrestler”; he was portraying a powerful figure onstage even as he was falling apart physically.

At the funeral, held in a chapel in Palm Beach, Springsteen paid passionate homage to Clemons, recalling that he had put up with a “world where it still wasn’t so easy to be big and black.” He recalled his friend’s “raunchy mysticism,” his appetites, even his dressing room, which was draped in exotic scarves and dubbed the Temple of Soul: “A visit there was like a trip to a sovereign nation that had just struck huge oil reserves.” At the same time, Springsteen gestured toward Clemons’s erratic family life (he was married five times) and the occasional tensions in their relationship. Speaking to Clemons’s sons, he said, “C lived a life where he did what he wanted to do, and he let the chips, human and otherwise, fall where they may. Like a lot of us, your pop was capable of great magic and also of making quite an amazing mess.”

Months later, Springsteen was still feeling the loss. He was twenty-two when he met Clemons, on the Asbury Park music circuit. Losing Clemons was like losing “the sea and the stars,” and it was clear that Springsteen was anxious about performing without him. “How do we continue? I think we discussed this more than anything in our history,” Van Zandt told me. “The basic concept was, we need to reinvent ourselves here a little bit. You can’t just replace a guy.” Clemons was replaced not by a musician but by a contingent—a five-man horn section.

Rehearsals were partly a matter of figuring out how to acknowledge the losses without turning the concert into a lugubrious memorial service. “The band is a little community up there,” Springsteen said, “and it gathers together, and we try to heal the parts that God broke and honor the parts that are no longer with us.”

During the breaks, I noticed that one of the horn players, a young tenor player wearing a considerable Afro, oblong eyewear, and an intent expression, was wandering around, nervously playing snatches of familiar solos on his horn: “Tenth Avenue Freeze Out,” “Jungleland,” “Badlands,” “Thunder Road.” This was Jake Clemons, Clarence’s thirty-two-year-old nephew. For years, Jake had been touring second-rate halls and clubs with his own band. Now he had the assignment of filling his uncle’s shoes in front of audiences of fifty thousand. He would do so literally. Jake wore his uncle’s size-16 shoes—snakeskin boots, slick loafers, whatever was left to him. Nearly all of his horns, too, had been gifts from Uncle Clarence.

In January, Springsteen invited Jake to his house, and they played long into the night. Bruce introduced the idea of his joining the band. “But you have to understand,” Springsteen told him. “When you blow that sax onstage with us, people won’t compare you to Clarence on the last tour. They’ll compare you to their memory of Clarence, to their idea of Clarence.” That gave Jake Clemons pause. Raised on gospel in a family led by a Marine-band officer, he knew Springsteen’s catalogue only casually. The audience would know the songs, not to mention the history of the band, much more intimately than he did. After Clarence died, Jake did a few tribute shows, and he could sense the audience making comparisons.

“I don’t know if anyone can perform in the shadow of a legend,” Jake said. “To me, Clarence is still on that stage, and I don’t want to step on his toes.”

Springsteen believed that these worries, and the larger sense of loss and injury, might provide an energy that the tour could draw on. After all these years onstage, he can stand back from his performances with an analytic remove. “You’re the shaman, a little bit, you’re leading the congregation,” he told me. “But you are the same as everybody else in the sense that your troubles are the same, your problems are the same, you’ve got your blessings, you’ve got your sins, you’ve got the things you can do well, you’ve got the things you fuck up all the time. And so you’re a conduit. There was a series of elements in your life—some that were blessings, and some that were just chaotic curses—that set fire to you in a certain way.”

When Springsteen was touring behind the “Born to Run” album, in the mid-seventies, he would stand at the lip of the stage in a spotlight, vamping on a chord, and tell the story of growing up in a dingy two-family house next to a gas station in a working-class section of Freehold known as Texas, because it was first populated by hillbilly migrants from the South. I was in the balcony at a show, in November, 1976, at the Palladium, on Fourteenth Street, when Springsteen laid things out in the starkest terms:



My mom, she was a secretary, and she worked downtown. . . . And my father, he worked a lot of different places. He worked in a rug mill for a while, he drove a cab for a while, and he was a guard down at the jail for a while. I can remember when he worked down there, he used to always come home real pissed off, drunk, sit in the kitchen. At night, nine o’clock, he used to shut off all the lights, every light in the house, and he used to get real pissed off if me or my sister turned any of them on. And he’d sit in the kitchen with a six-pack, a cigarette. . . .


He’d make me sit down at that table in the dark. In the wintertime, he used to turn on the gas stove and close all the doors, so it got real hot in there. And I remember just sitting in the dark. . . . No matter how long I sat there, I could never ever see his face. We’d start talking about nothing much, how I was doing. Pretty soon, he asked me what I thought I was doing with myself. And we’d always end up screaming at each other. My mother, she’d always end up running in from the front room crying, and trying to pull him off me, try to keep us from fighting with each other. . . . I’d always end up running out the back door and pulling away from him. Pulling away from him, running down the driveway screaming at him, telling him, telling him, telling him, how it was my life and I was going to do what I wanted to do.




At the end of the story, an entirely accurate one, Springsteen would segue into “It’s My Life,” by the Animals, a spine-jangling declaration of independence. In Springsteen’s voice, it was a declaration of independence from a household in which threats were shouted, telephones were ripped off the wall, and the police were summoned.

Doug Springsteen was an Army driver in Europe during the Second World War who came home and seethed at his crabbed circumstances. Van Zandt told me that Springsteen’s father was “scary” and best avoided. In those days, “all fathers were scary,” Van Zandt said. “The torture we put these poor guys through, when you think of it now. My father, Bruce’s father—these poor guys, they never had a chance. There was no precedent for us, none, in history, for their sons to become these long-haired freaks who didn’t want to participate in the world they built for them. Can you imagine? It was the World War Two generation. They built the suburbs. What gratitude did we have? We’re, like, ‘Fuck you! We’re gonna look like girls, and we’re gonna do drugs, and we’re gonna play crazy rock and roll!’ And they’re, like, ‘What the fuck did we do wrong?’ They were scared of what we were becoming, so they felt they had to be more authoritarian. They hated us, you know?”

Doug Springsteen grew up shadowed by the death of his five-year-old sister, Virginia, who was hit by a truck while riding a tricycle, in Freehold in 1927. His parents, according to a forthcoming biography of Springsteen by Peter Ames Carlin, were ravaged by grief. Doug dropped out of school after ninth grade. In 1948, he married Adele Zerilli. Bruce was born the next year. For long stretches of Bruce’s childhood, his grandparents lived with his family, and, as Springsteen told Carlin, he always sensed that much of the affection he received from them was a way “to replace the lost child,” which was confusing: “The dead daughter was a big presence. Her portrait was on the wall, always front and center.” Decades after the event, the whole family––the grandparents, Doug and Adele, Bruce and his sister Ginny––went to the cemetery every weekend to visit Virginia’s grave.

In biographies and clippings, Doug Springsteen is described with adjectives like “taciturn” and “disappointed.” In fact, he seems to have been bipolar, and he was capable of terrible rages, often aimed at his son. Doctors prescribed drugs for his illness, but Doug didn’t always take them. The mediator in the house, the source of optimism and survival, and the steadiest earner, was Bruce’s mother, Adele, who worked as a legal secretary. Still, Bruce was deeply affected by his father’s paralyzing depressions, and worried that he would not escape the thread of mental instability that ran through his family. That fear, he says, is why he never did drugs. Doug Springsteen lives in his son’s songs. In “Independence Day,” the son must escape his father’s house because “we were just too much of the same kind.” In the ferocious “Adam Raised a Cain,” the father “walks these empty rooms / looking for something to blame / You inherit the sins / You inherit the flames.” The songs were a way of talking to the silent father. “My dad was very nonverbal—you couldn’t really have a conversation with him,” Springsteen told me. “I had to make my peace with that, but I had to have a conversation with him, because I needed to have one. It ain’t the best way to go about it, but that was the only way I could, so I did, and eventually he did respond. He might not have liked the songs, but I think he liked that they existed. It meant that he mattered. He’d get asked, ‘What are your favorite songs?’ And he’d say, ‘The ones that are about me.’ ”

The past, though, is anything but past. “My parents’ struggles, it’s the subject of my life,” Springsteen told me at rehearsal. “It’s the thing that eats at me and always will. My life took a very different course, but my life is an anomaly. Those wounds stay with you, and you turn them into a language and a purpose.” Gesturing toward the band onstage, he said, “We’re repairmen—repairmen with a toolbox. If I repair a little of myself, I’ll repair a little of you. That’s the job.” The songs of escape on “Born to Run,” the portrait of post-industrial struggle on “Darkness on the Edge of Town” were part of that job of early repair.

Doug and Adele Springsteen left Freehold for northern California when Bruce was nineteen, and they were puzzled when, several years later, their son, a long-haired misfit in their eyes, came visiting, as he puts it, “lugging a treasure chest behind” and telling them to buy the biggest house around. “The one satisfaction you get is that you do get your ‘See, I told you so’ moment,” Springsteen said. “Of course, all the deeper things go unsaid, that it all could have been a little different.”

Doug Springsteen died in 1998, at seventy-three, after years of illness, including a stroke and heart disease. “I was lucky that modern medicine gave him another ten years of life,” Springsteen said. “T-Bone Burnett said that rock and roll is all about ‘Daaaaddy!’ It’s one embarrassing scream of ‘Daaaaddy!’ It’s just fathers and sons, and you’re out there proving something to somebody in the most intense way possible. It’s, like, ‘Hey, I was worth a little more attention than I got! You blew that one, big guy!’ ”

The redemptive moments in Springsteen’s youth were musical: the songs coming out of the transistor radio and the television set; his mother taking out a bank loan for sixty dollars to buy him a Kent guitar when he was fifteen. Springsteen became one of those kids who escape into an obsession. He believed, as he sings in “No Surrender,” “We learned more from a three-minute record, baby, than we ever learned in school.” At St. Rose of Lima, the Catholic school in Freehold, he was a screwup, disdained by the nuns. The hip, literary kids were far away. (“I didn’t hang around with no crowd that was talking about William Burroughs,” he told Dave Marsh, an early biographer.) After graduating from high school, Springsteen attended classes at Ocean County Community College, where he started reading novels and writing poems, but he quit after a nervous administrator, on the lookout for hippies and other undesirables, made it plain to Springsteen that there had been “complaints” that he was strange. “Remember, we didn’t go into this life because we were courageous or brilliant,” Van Zandt said. “We were the last guys standing. Anyone with a choice to do something else—be a dentist, get a real job, whatever—took it!”

The place where Springsteen went looking for his future was just a short drive east of Freehold—the Asbury Park music scene. In the sixties and seventies, there were dozens of bands that played in the bars along the boardwalk. Asbury Park became Springsteen’s Liverpool, his Tupelo, his Hibbing.

On a spring afternoon, I stood out in front of the best-known club in Asbury Park, the Stone Pony, and waited for an aging drummer named Vini (Mad Dog) Lopez, the unluckiest man in the E Street saga. Lopez was thrown out of the Springsteen band just before they hit it big. Springsteen’s bandmates may be employees, but they have been handsomely paid and are worth many millions of dollars each. The drummer who made it for the long haul, Max Weinberg, owns houses in the New Jersey countryside and Tuscany. Lopez works as a caddy. On weekends, he plays in a band called License to Chill. The band’s mascot is Tippy the Banana. “We’re at the bottom of the food chain,” Lopez told me. “We like to say that we’re exclusive but inexpensive.”

Lopez pulled up to the Pony in a beat-up Saturn. He climbed out of the car creakily, as if out of a space capsule after an interplanetary voyage. He squinted in the ocean light and limped toward me. He’d been in a car wreck on the way home from a memorial concert for Clarence Clemons. His knee was shot, and so was his back. Also, someone had dropped an amplifier on his foot at a gig a couple of nights before. “That didn’t help,” he said.

We walked along the boardwalk for a while and settled on a place to eat. On the way, and throughout lunch, people stopped him to say hello, to get an autograph.

In 1969, Lopez invited Springsteen to jam at an after-hours loft, called the Upstage, above a Thom McAn shoe store in Asbury Park. Eventually, Springsteen and Lopez formed a band called Child, which they soon renamed Steel Mill. It featured Lopez on drums, Danny Federici on organ and accordion, and Steve Van Zandt on bass. The boys lived for a while in a surfboard factory run by their manager. “Bruce lived in the front office, and Danny and I had daybeds in the bathrooms,” Lopez said. They made around fifty dollars a week. Some of the band members held manual jobs to make ends meet: Van Zandt worked construction, Lopez put in time at a boatyard and on commercial fishing boats. Springsteen declined. The future working-class clarion never really worked.

Lopez took a long sip of his Bloody Mary and stared out at the ocean, where a surfer bobbed on a wave and fell. Springsteen still throws some extra royalties his way from the first two albums—“He does it out of the goodness of his heart,” Lopez said—but it’s not a living.

The Springsteen Lopez describes was a young man of uncommon ambition who was also prone to bouts of withdrawal. For all the girls around, for all the late-night Monopoly games and pinball marathons, Springsteen wasn’t easily distracted. “Bruce would come to a party where people were doing all kinds of things, and he would just go off with his guitar,” Lopez said.

For Van Zandt, that intensity was a lure. He recognized in Springsteen a drive to create original work. In those days, he said, you were judged by how well you could copy songs off the radio and play them, chord for chord, note for note: “Bruce was never good at it. He had a weird ear. He would hear different chords, but he could never hear the right chords. When you have that ability or inability, you immediately become more original. Well, in the long run, guess what: in the long run, original wins.”

Asbury Park, for all its brassy bar bands and boardwalk barkers, was not immune to the times. On the July 4th weekend in 1970, race riots broke out. Young blacks in town were especially angry that most of the summer jobs in the restaurants and stores along the boardwalk were going to white kids. Springsteen and his bandmates watched the flames on Springwood Avenue from a water tower near their surfboard-factory home. Nevertheless, Bruce’s crowd remained almost completely apolitical. “The riots just meant that certain clubs didn’t open and certain ones did,” Van Zandt said.

As Steel Mill dissolved, Springsteen dreamed up a temporary lark: Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom, a kind of Noah’s-ark carnival act, with two of everything—guitarists, drummers, singers—plus Garry Tallent on tuba, a baton twirler, and two guys from the Upstage who played Monopoly onstage. Then Springsteen got serious. He formed his own band. He called it the Bruce Springsteen Band.

A week after closing down rehearsals at Fort Monmouth, Springsteen and the band start rehearsing at the Sun National Bank Center, the home of the Trenton Titans, a minor-league hockey team. The theatre at Fort Monmouth was secluded and cheap, but not nearly large enough for the crew to set up the full travelling stage, with all the proper lights, risers, ramps, and sound system.

Inside the arena, Springsteen is walking around the empty seats, a microphone in his hand, giving stage directions. “We can’t see the singers from this angle,” he says. “One step to the right, Cindy!” The crew moves the riser. Cindy Mizelle, the most soulful voice in the new, seventeen-piece version of the E Street Band, takes one step to the right.

Springsteen lopes to another corner, and, as he sets his gaze on the horn section, a thought occurs to him. “Do we have some chairs for those guys when they aren’t playing?” he says. His voice ricochets around the empty seats. Chairs appear.

The band gets in position and starts to rip through the basic set list in preparation for the Apollo show. Lofgren plays the slippery opening riff of “We Take Care of Our Own”—a recession anthem in the key of G—and the band is off. Springsteen rehearses deliberately, working out all the spontaneous-seeming moves and postures: the solemn lowered head and raised fist, the hoisted talismanic Fender, the between-songs patter, the look of exultation in a single spotlight that he will enact in front of an audience. (“It’s theatre, you know,” he tells me later. “I’m a theatrical performer. I’m whispering in your ear, and you’re dreaming my dreams, and then I’m getting a feeling for yours. I’ve been doing that for forty years.”) Springsteen has to do so much—lead the band, pace the show, sing, play guitar, command the audience, project to every corner of the hall, including the seats behind the stage—that to wing it completely is asking for disaster.

In the midst of the fifth song in the set, he introduces the band. As they run through a vamp of “People Get Ready,” the old Curtis Mayfield tune, Springsteen grabs a mike and strolls across the stage. “Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,” he says to the empty arena. “I’m so glad to be here in your beautiful city tonight. The E Street Band has come back to bring the power, hour after hour, to put a whup-ass session on the recession. We got some old friends, and we got some new friends, and we’ve got a story to tell you . . .”

The tune, thick with horns and vocal harmonies, elides into “My City of Ruins,” one of the elegiac, gospel-tinged songs on the 9/11 album, “The Rising.” The voices sing “Rise up! Rise up!” and there comes a string of horn solos: trombone, trumpet, sax. Then back to the voices. Springsteen quickly introduces the E Street horns and the singing collective. Then he says, “Roll call!” And, with the music rising bit by churchly bit, he introduces the core of the band: “Professor Roy Bittan is in the house. . . . Charlie Giordano is in the house. . . .”

When he finishes the roll call, there is a long ellipsis. The band keeps vamping.

“Are we missing anybody?”

Two spotlights are now trained on the organ, where Federici once sat, and at the mike where Clemons once stood.

“Are we missing anybody?”

Then again: “Are we missing anybody? . . . That’s right. That’s right. We’re missing some. But the only thing I can guarantee tonight is that if you’re here and we’re here, then they’re here!” He repeats this over and over, the volume of the piano and the bass rising, the drums hastening, the voices rising, until finally the song overwhelms him, and, if Springsteen has calculated correctly, there will not be an unmoved soul in the house.

For the next hour and a half, the band plays through a set that alternates tales of economic pain with party-time escape. While the band plays the jolly opening riff of “Waiting on a Sunny Day,” Springsteen practices striding around the stage, beckoning the imaginary hordes everywhere in the arena to sing along. There is a swagger in his stride. He is the rare man of sixty-two who is not shy about showing his ass—an ass finely sausaged into a pair of alarmingly tight black jeans—to twenty thousand paying customers. “Go, Jakie!” he cries, and brings Jake Clemons downstage to solo. He practically has to kick him into the spotlight.

A bunch of songs later, after a run-through of the set-ending “Thunder Road,” Springsteen hops off the stage, drapes a towel around his neck, and sits down in the folding chair next to me.

“The top of the show, see, is a kind of welcoming, and you are getting everyone comfortable and challenging them at the same time,” he says. “You’re setting out your themes. You’re getting them comfortable, because, remember, people haven’t seen this band. There are absences that are hanging there. That’s what we’re about right now, the communication between the living and the gone. Those currents even run through the dream world of pop music!”

It’s a sweet day for Springsteen. “Wrecking Ball” is the No. 1 album in the U.S. and in the United Kingdom, passing Adele’s blockbuster “21.” “This is great news, but we’ll see where we are in a few weeks,” Landau says. Springsteen will never again have huge sellers like “Born in the U.S.A.,” but he will always get an initial burst of sales from his fan base. How sales sustain over time is the question. (The answer is that they don’t: after a month, “Wrecking Ball” dropped to No. 19. By summer, it had fallen off the charts.) What makes Springsteen an economic power at this point is his status as a live performer.

Onstage, an impromptu party is forming. The crew passes out flutes of champagne and plates of cake to celebrate the news about “Wrecking Ball.”

“That never gets old,” Springsteen says, before heading off to join the party. “I’m still excited hearing the music on the radio! I remember the first time I ever saw someone hearing me on the radio. We were in Connecticut playing at some college. A guy was in his car, a warm summer night, and his window was rolled down, and ‘Spirit in the Night’ ”—a song from Springsteen’s début album—“was coming out of the car. Wow. I remember thinking, That’s it, I’ve realized at least a part of my rock-and-roll dreams. It still feels the same to me. To hear it come out of the radio—it’s an all-points bulletin. The song’s going out . . . there!”

By 1972, Springsteen was fronting a band and writing songs to be performed solo. He wasn’t a big reader at the time, but he was so consumed by Bob Dylan’s songs that he read Anthony Scaduto’s biography. He was impressed by Dylan’s coming-to-New York saga: the snowstorm arrival, in 1961, from the Midwest; the pilgrimages to Woody Guthrie’s bedside at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital; the first appearances at Café Wha? and Gerde’s Folk City; and then the audition for John Hammond, the legendary Columbia Records executive. This was what he wanted, some version of it.

Springsteen’s manager at the time was a rambunctious hustler named Mike Appel. Before joining Springsteen, Appel wrote jingles for Kleenex and a song for the Partridge Family. Appel was old school—passionate but exploitative. He signed Springsteen to lopsided contracts. And yet he was so ballsy and unhinged in his devotion to his client that he would do wild things on his behalf, like calling a producer at NBC to suggest that the network have Springsteen perform his antiwar song “Balboa vs. the Earth Slayer” at the Super Bowl. (NBC declined.) Somehow, Appel did manage to get an appointment with John Hammond.

On May 2, 1972, Springsteen travelled to the city by bus, carrying a borrowed acoustic guitar with no case. The meeting didn’t begin well. Hammond, a patrician of Vanderbilt stock, made it clear that he was pressed for time, and he was repelled when Appel put on the hard sell about the singer’s lyrical gifts. But the vibe changed when Springsteen, sitting on a stool across from the desk, sang a string of songs ending with “If I Was a Priest”:



Well, now, if Jesus was the sheriff


And I was the priest, 


If my lady was an heiress 


and my mama was a thief . . .




“Bruce, that’s the damnedest song I’ve ever heard,” Hammond said, delighted. “Were you brought up by nuns?”

Columbia signed Springsteen to a record contract and tried to promote him as “the new Dylan.” He was not the only one. John Prine, Elliot Murphy, Loudon Wainwright III, and other singer-songwriter sensitivos were also getting the “new Dylan” label. (“The old Dylan was only thirty, so I don’t even know why they needed a fucking new Dylan,” Springsteen says.) To Hammond’s disappointment, Springsteen recorded his first two albums—“Greetings from Asbury Park” and “The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle”—with a band made up of his Jersey Shore mates, including Vini Lopez, on drums, and Clarence Clemons, on tenor sax. Hammond was convinced that the solo demos were better. Despite boosts from a few critics and d.j.s, the albums hardly sold at all. Springsteen was, at best, a gifted obscurity, a provincial who was running out of chances.

In June, 1973, when I was fourteen, I got on a Red & Tan 11-C bus in north Jersey with a couple of friends and went to the city to see a resolutely un-hip and unaccountably popular band called Chicago, at Madison Square Garden. I am not quite sure why I went. We were Dylan fanatics. “Howl,” the Stanley Brothers, Otis Redding, “Naked Lunch,” Hank Williams, Odetta—practically anything I knew or read or heard seemed to come through the auspices of Dylan. Chicago was about as far from the Dylan aesthetic as you could get.

All the same, I’d paid my four dollars, and I was going to see whatever I could glimpse from our seats. Out trundled the opening act: someone named Bruce Springsteen. The conditions were abysmal, as they often are for opening acts: the houselights were up, the crowd was alternately inattentive and hostile. What I remember was a bandleader as frenetic as Mick Jagger or James Brown, a singer bursting with almost self-destructive urgency, trying to bust through the buzzy indifference of the crowd. After that show, Springsteen swore to Appel that he would never open or play big venues again. “I couldn’t stand it—everybody was so far away and the band couldn’t hear,” he told Dave Marsh. It was time to woodshed, time to build an audience through constant, intense performance in clubs, small theatres, and university gyms.

These were lean times. After Appel had paid expenses and taken his considerable cut, the pay was next to nothing. Sometimes the band slept in the van. Clemons nearly got arrested before a gig for failing to pay child support. Lopez was especially vocal about playing for seeds: “What if I want to take my girlfriend out for a burger?”

In the late afternoon, after lunch, Lopez and I were driving around Asbury Park and he started laughing and pointing. “That’s where we went to get food stamps—all of us, Bruce, too,” he said.

Lopez was a lot of drummer, too much drummer, perhaps—a chaotic Ginger Baker type. He was also fiery in his style of labor unrest. In early 1974, he roughed up Mike Appel’s brother in a dispute over money (“I did push him a little”). Soon afterward, Springsteen told Lopez that he was fired.

“I used to keep his guitars at my house, and he had to come get them,” Lopez said. “I asked for a second chance, and he said, ‘Vini, there are no second chances.’ Christ. Danny got all kinds of second chances after being a bad boy—for drugs, for not showing up or for being late. But for me no second chances.” The argument grew more heated, and Springsteen finally suggested that Lopez was an inadequate drummer.

“I put his guitars down in front of him, and I said, ‘There’s the door. You know what it’s used for.’ To this day we haven’t talked about it. There’s nothing to talk about. I’d have been in the biggest band in the land if that hadn’t happened. But, historically, at least, I was in the E Street Band. Bruce knows that, and everyone knows that.”

We drove past the low-slung building that used to house the surfboard factory where Lopez lived with Springsteen. The sign on the door now reads, “Immunostics Inc: Quality microbiological, serological and immunological reagents.” Around ten times over the years, Springsteen has had Lopez sit in with the band, including at Giants Stadium for a rendition of “Spirit in the Night.” When Lopez asked if he could start a band that played all the old Steel Mill songs, Springsteen smiled and said sure, go ahead.

“But it’s hard to sell Steel Mill now,” Lopez said. “People know that Bruce wrote all the stuff and so they expect Bruce to show up, and that just ain’t gonna happen.”

If Vini Lopez is the unluckiest drummer in American history, Jon Landau is surely the most fortunate of rock critics. During a break in the rehearsals for the 2012 tour, I drove up to northern Westchester, where Landau lives with his wife, Barbara. Landau is just three years older than Springsteen, but he is a man of more ordinary physical presence. Landau has been getting a healthy cut of the Springsteen business for more than thirty years. The profits did not go up his nose; they went on the walls. His art collection (mainly Renaissance painting and sculpture, with some nineteenth-century French painting thrown into the mix) is what is called “important.” At the risk of alarming his insurance company, I can report the presence of works by, among others, Titian, Tintoretto, Tiepolo, Donatello, Ghiberti, Géricault, Delacroix, Corot, and Courbet.

But Landau has not escaped time unscathed. Last year, he had a growth surgically removed from his brain, and, because the growth was lodged near a tangle of optic nerves, he lost the vision in one eye. The recovery was not easy, and, at times, as we toured the paintings, Landau seemed winded. After the surgery, Springsteen was with Landau nearly every day. “He knew I was going through something, and I thought I was going to die,” Landau said. “It wasn’t rational, but the fear was there. . . . We shared a lot of deep talk.” Then he smiled. “The deep thinkers did some deep thinking.”

Landau began his life in a profession that didn’t really exist. Even by 1966, three years after the rise of the Beatles, there really was no such thing as rock criticism. That year, Landau, a precocious teen-ager from Lexington, Massachusetts, was working in a Cambridge music store called Briggs & Briggs. His father was a left-wing history teacher who moved the family from Brooklyn during the blacklists and got a job at Acoustic Research. Landau grew up on folk music, and in high school he went to every rock concert he could afford. At Briggs & Briggs, he met a Swarthmore student named Paul Williams, who had just started a mimeographed, three-staple magazine called Crawdaddy!, perhaps the first publication devoted to rock criticism. As an undergraduate at Brandeis, Landau wrote for Crawdaddy! When he was a junior, Jann Wenner invited him to write a column for a biweekly he was starting, to be called Rolling Stone.

As a critic, Landau was nothing if not bold. For the inaugural issue of Rolling Stone, in 1967, he panned Jimi Hendrix’s classic “Are You Experienced?” The next year, he walloped Cream for the loose bombast of their live shows, adding that Eric Clapton, the band’s lead guitarist, was a “master of the blues clichés of all the post-World War II blues guitarists . . . a virtuoso at performing other people’s ideas.” At the time, Clapton was known as “God.” The review gave God a fit of self-doubt. “The ring of truth just knocked me backward; I was in a restaurant and I fainted,” Clapton said years later. “And after I woke up, I immediately decided that that was the end of the band.” Cream broke up.

Landau loved the well-wrought single, whether by the Beatles or Sam and Dave; he was suspicious of arty self-indulgence. “More and more people expect of rock what they used to expect of philosophy, literature, films, and visual art,” he wrote. “Others expect of rock what they used to get out of drugs. And in my opinion, rock cannot withstand that kind of burden because it forces onto rock qualities which are the negation of what rock was all about in the first place.”

In those days, there wasn’t a sharp line between the rock industry and rock journalism; in 1969, Jann Wenner produced a Boz Scaggs record. Landau produced albums with Livingston Taylor and the MC5. Landau admired musically savvy executives, like Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler, and he approved of musicians who understood the virtues of popularity. In his senior honors thesis at Brandeis, he wrote admiringly of Otis Redding’s willingness to be an entertainer “openly and honestly concerned with pleasing crowds and being successful.”

By the end of 1971, Landau was living in Boston and married to the critic Janet Maslin. Although he had Crohn’s disease and was ailing, he was the energetic center of a circle of emerging young critics: Dave Marsh, John Rockwell, Robert Christgau, Paul Nelson, Greil Marcus. Landau took notice of Springsteen’s first album, “Greetings from Asbury Park,” assigning the review to Lester Bangs, in Rolling Stone; he reviewed the second, “The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle,” in the alternative weekly The Real Paper, calling Springsteen “the most impressive new singer-songwriter since James Taylor,” but he added that “the album is not as well-produced as it ought to have been.” It was “a mite thin or trebly-sounding, especially when the band moves into the breaks.”

Landau, who was twenty-six at the time, accepted an invitation from Dave Marsh to go to Charley’s, a club in Cambridge, to check out Springsteen’s act. “I went to this club, and it was completely empty,” he told me. “He had the smallest of cult followings. Before the show, I asked the guys in the bar where Bruce was, and they pointed outside.”

Springsteen was standing in the cold—a skinny bearded guy in jeans and a T-shirt, hopping up and down to keep warm. He was reading Landau’s record review, which the management had put in the window.

“I stood next to him and said, ‘What do you think?’ ” Landau recounted. “And he said, ‘This guy is usually pretty good, but I’ve seen better.’ I introduced myself, and we had a good laugh.”

The next day, he got a call from Springsteen. “We talked for hours,” Landau said. “About music, about philosophy. The core of him then was the same as it is now. And, you know, we’ve been having that conversation for the rest of our lives: about growth, about thinking big thoughts, about big things.”

A month later, Landau went to see Springsteen at the Harvard Square Theatre, where he was opening for Bonnie Raitt. It was the eve of Landau’s twenty-seventh birthday, and he was feeling prematurely worn out. His career was at a standstill. The Crohn’s disease was making it hard to eat or work. His marriage was falling apart. But that night, May 9, 1974, he felt rejuvenated as Springsteen played everything from the old Fats Domino tune “Let the Four Winds Blow” to a new song about escape and liberation called “Born to Run.”

The article that Landau wrote for The Real Paper is the most famous review in the history of rock criticism:



Last Thursday, at the Harvard Square Theatre, I saw my rock ’n’ roll past flash before my eyes. And I saw something else: I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time. . . . He is a rock ’n’ roll punk, a Latin street poet, a ballet dancer, an actor, a joker, bar band leader, hot-shit rhythm guitar player, extraordinary singer, and a truly great rock ’n’ roll composer. He leads a band like he has been doing it forever. . . . He parades in front of his all-star rhythm band like a cross between Chuck Berry, early Bob Dylan, and Marlon Brando.




Columbia Records used the line “I saw rock and roll future” as the centerpiece of an ad campaign. Springsteen befriended Landau, who came to stay with him at his ramshackle house, in Long Branch. “Modest doesn’t even begin to describe the house,” Landau recalled. “There was a couch, his bed, a guitar, and his records. And we were up till 8 A.M. talking.” The two men listened to music and talked about Springsteen’s third record. Columbia was not likely to keep investing in Springsteen if the third record failed. Springsteen appreciated Appel’s loyalty, but his way of making high-handed judgments grated. Landau was more subtle, asking questions, flattering, suggesting, recommending. Springsteen invited Landau into the studio, where he helped Springsteen cut “Thunder Road” from seven minutes to four and advised him to revise the opening of “Jungleland.”

“I had a youthful conviction that I knew what I was doing,” Landau said. Springsteen told Appel that he was bringing in Landau as co-producer.

“Born to Run,” which was released in August, 1975, transformed Springsteen’s career, and the ten-show stand at the Bottom Line early in the tour remains a rock date to rival James Brown at the Apollo or Dylan at Newport. At the Bottom Line, Springsteen became himself. By adding Van Zandt as a second guitar player, he was liberated from some of his musical duties, and he became a full-throttle front man, leaping off amps and pianos, frog-hopping from one tabletop to the next.

Landau quit his job as a critic and became, in essence, Springsteen’s adjutant: his friend, his adviser in all things, his producer, and, by 1978, his manager. After a prolonged legal battle that kept Springsteen out of the studio for two years, Appel was bought off and cast out.

Landau fed Springsteen’s curiosity about the world beyond music. He gave Springsteen books to read—Steinbeck, Flannery O’Connor—and movies to see, particularly John Ford and Howard Hawks Westerns. Springsteen started to think in larger terms than cars and highways; he began to look at his own story, his family’s story, in terms of class and American archetypes. The imagery, the storytelling, and the sense of place in those novels and films helped fuel his songs. Landau was also a catalyst in making Springsteen into a big business, pressing him to play bigger halls, overcoming his nightmarish early performances at Madison Square Garden. And he pressed him to think of himself the way Otis Redding did—as both an artist and an entertainer on a large stage.

Some critics have depicted Landau as an avaricious Svengali, a Colonel Parker, or worse. But the people I’ve talked to in the music business dismiss any idea of malign or overweening influence on Springsteen. “The idea that he’d be manipulated is so preposterous,” Danny Goldberg, who has known Springsteen for more than thirty years, says. As Goldberg, who has managed Nirvana and Sonic Youth, puts it, “It’s Bruce who uses Jon, to achieve complete artistic control.” Landau is sensitive to any claim that he is somehow controlling his client or responsible for his trajectory. “The first principle of being a manager is being a fiduciary for the artist—his interests come first,” he says. “So when you are working with him, no matter what the issue is, the first question is, What’s the best thing for Bruce?” Springsteen, he went on, “is the smartest person I’ve ever known—not the most informed or the most educated—but the smartest. If you are ever confronted with a situation—a practical matter, an artistic problem—his read of the people involved is exquisite. He is way ahead.”

At one point a decade ago, Springsteen rewarded Landau, who had once dreamed of becoming a rock star himself, by calling him onstage. “Bruce told me one night I should strap on a guitar when we got to ‘Dancing in the Dark,’ and for five or six nights I came out,” Landau told me one night backstage. “It’s just a tremendous high. But then on the seventh night he said, ‘You know, it’s great you comin’ out onstage. But I was thinking that maybe we should give that a rest tonight.’ ”

“You mean I’m fired?” Landau said.

Springsteen smiled and said, “Well, yeah. That’s about the size of it.”

As Springsteen grew more worldly, he became far more political. He did not start out that way. In 1972, he played a small benefit for George McGovern, at a movie theatre in Red Bank, but, as a young man, his interest in the music was almost completely as a source of personal liberation. He had not made the connection between his father’s drift and the politics of unemployment, the depression of Freehold and the wave of deindustrialization.

A political consciousness could be felt on “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” and it grew in the years that followed. He began to find the voice for that by reading—Landau’s enthusiasms played a role here—and by travelling, and, crucially, by listening to country and folk music: to Hank Williams and Woody Guthrie. Springsteen knew he had run out of things to say about desperate nights on the Turnpike; he wanted to write songs he could sing as an adult, about marriage, about being a father, and about larger social issues. As he listened again and again to Hank Williams, he said, the songs went from “archival to alive.” What had seemed “cranky and old-fashioned” now had depth and darkness; Williams represented “the adult blues,” and the music of the working class. “Country by its nature appealed to me, country was provincial, and so was I,” Springsteen said in a recent speech, in Austin. “I felt I was an average guy with a slightly above-average gift . . . and country was about the truth emanating out of your sweat, out of your local bar, your corner store.” He read Joe Klein’s biography of Guthrie. He read memoirs by the civil-rights lawyer Morris Dees and the antiwar activist Ron Kovic. All this fed into the working-class anthems of “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” the acoustic howl of “Nebraska,” and even the anthemic pop of “Born in the U.S.A.” He was singing now about Vietnam veterans, migrant workers, class, social divisions, deindustrialized cities, and forgotten American towns, but never in an idiom that threatened “Bruce”—the iconic family-friendly rock star. From the stage, he began to deliver paeans to his causes and ask for donations to local food banks, but the language was never threatening or alienating, and the gate receipts and record sales were beyond fabulous.

Some detected in all this the stink of sanctimony. In 1985, James Wolcott, a punk and New Wave enthusiast, found himself weary of Springsteen’s “cornball” sincerity and the level of praise accorded him by the “city-slick Establishment.” “Piety has begun to collect around Springsteen’s curly head like mist around a mountaintop,” Wolcott wrote in Vanity Fair. “The mountain can’t be blamed for the mist, but still—the reverence is getting awfully thick.” For Tom Carson, the problem was insufficient radicalism—the fact that Springsteen remained, at heart, conventionally liberal. Springsteen “thought rock and roll was basically wholesome,” Carson wrote in L.A. Weekly. “It was an alternative, an escape—but not a rebellion, either as a route to forbidden sexual or social fruit, or, by extension, as a rejection of conventional society. To him, rock redeemed conventional society.”

In the marketplace of arena rock, that measure of conventionality was a strength, not a limitation. By the mid-eighties, Springsteen was the biggest rock star in the world, capable of selling out Giants Stadium ten shows in a row. He was so unthreatening to American values that, in 1984, George Will went to see him. Wearing a bow tie, a double-breasted blazer, and earplugs, Will watched Springsteen perform in Washington and wrote a column called “A Yankee Doodle Springsteen”: “I have not got a clue about Springsteen’s politics. . . . He is no whiner, and the recitation of closed factories and other problems always seems punctuated by a grand, cheerful affirmation: ‘Born in the U.S.A.!’ ” A week later, Ronald Reagan went to New Jersey to give a campaign speech. Taking his cue from Will, Reagan said, “America’s future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts; it rests in the message of hope in songs so many young Americans admire: New Jersey’s own Bruce Springsteen.”

Springsteen was appalled. He later said that “Born in the U.S.A.” was “the most misunderstood song since ‘Louie, Louie,’ ” and he began to sing an acoustic version that leached it of its bombast and made its dark shadings plainer. From the stage, he said, “Well, the President was mentioning my name in his speech the other day, and I kind of got to wondering what his favorite album of mine must’ve been, you know? I don’t think it was the ‘Nebraska’ album. I don’t think he’s been listening to this one.” Springsteen played “Johnny 99,” the bleak story of a laid-off Jersey autoworker who, in drunken despair, kills a night clerk in a botched robbery.

Someone once said to Paul McCartney that the Beatles were “anti-materialistic.” McCartney had to laugh.

“That’s a huge myth,” he replied. “John and I literally used to sit down and say, ‘Now, let’s write a swimming pool.’ ”

With the “Born in the U.S.A.” album, Springsteen combined political virtue and popular appeal, protest and party time. When he was writing the songs for the album that became “Born in the U.S.A.,” Landau told him that they had a great record, but they still didn’t have a swimming pool. They needed a hit.

“Look, I’ve written seventy songs,” Springsteen replied. “You want another one, you write it!” Then he sulkily retreated to his hotel suite and wrote “Dancing in the Dark.” The lyrics reflected the played-out frustration of an artist who “ain’t got nothing to say,” but the music—a pop confection buttressed by a hummable synthesizer line—went down easy. “It went as far in the direction of pop music as I wanted to go—and probably a little farther,” Springsteen recalled in a text for his book of lyrics, “Songs.” “My heroes, from Hank Williams to Frank Sinatra to Bob Dylan, were popular musicians. They had hits. There was value in trying to connect with a large audience.” “Born in the U.S.A.” went platinum and became the best-selling record of 1985 and of Springsteen’s career.

When Springsteen and Van Zandt were young, they had “pink Cadillac” dreams, fantasies of wealth and rock-and-roll glory. “I knew I was never going to be Woody Guthrie,” Springsteen recalled, in Austin. “I liked Elvis, I liked the pink Cadillac too much, I like the simplicity and the tossed-off temporary feeling of pop hits, I like a big fuckin’ noise, and, in my own way, I like the luxuries, and the comforts, of being a star.” He bought a fourteen-million-dollar estate in Beverly Hills. He remained friends with his old running mates from Jersey, but he also made new friends, famous friends. When he married an actress named Julianne Phillips, in 1985, they honeymooned at Gianni Versace’s villa on Lake Como. Later, there were vintage cars and motorcycles, a state-of-the-art home recording studio, horses, and, the ultimate sign of class ascent, organic farming. Tours grew to corporate scale: private jets, five-star hotels, elaborate catering, massage therapists, efficient management.

Springsteen was aware of the comical contradiction: the multimillionaire who, in his theatrical self-presentation, is the voice of the dispossessed. Very occasionally, twinges of discomfort about this have leaked into his lyrics. In the late eighties, Springsteen played “Ain’t Got You,” which appeared on his album “Tunnel of Love,” for Van Zandt. The lyrics tell of a fellow who gets “paid a king’s ransom for doin’ what comes naturally”—who’s got “the fortunes of heaven” and a “house full of Rembrandt and priceless art”—but lacks the affections of his beloved. Van Zandt recognized the self-mockery but didn’t care. He was aghast.

“We had one of our biggest fights of our lives,” Van Zandt recalled. “I’m, like, ‘What the fuck is this?’ And he’s, like, ‘Well, what do you mean, it’s the truth. It’s just who I am, it’s my life.’ And I’m, like, ‘This is bullshit. People don’t need you talking about your life. Nobody gives a shit about your life. They need you for their lives. That’s your thing. Giving some logic and reason and sympathy and passion to this cold, fragmented, confusing world—that’s your gift. Explaining their lives to them. Their lives, not yours.’ And we fought and fought and fought and fought. He says ‘Fuck you,’ I say ‘Fuck you.’ I think something in what I said probably resonated.”

Springsteen was also experiencing intervals of depression that were far more serious than the occasional guilt trip about being “a rich man in a poor man’s shirt,” as he sings in “Better Days.” A cloud of crisis hovered as Springsteen was finishing his acoustic masterpiece “Nebraska,” in 1982. He drove from the East Coast to California and then drove straight back. “He was feeling suicidal,” Springsteen’s friend and biographer Dave Marsh said. “The depression wasn’t shocking, per se. He was on a rocket ride, from nothing to something, and now you are getting your ass kissed day and night. You might start to have some inner conflicts about your real self-worth.”

Springsteen began questioning why his relationships were a series of drive-bys. And he could not let go of the past, either—a sense that he had inherited his father’s depressive self-isolation. For years, he would drive at night past his parents’ old house in Freehold, sometimes three or four times a week. In 1982, he started seeing a psychotherapist. At a concert years later, Springsteen introduced his song “My Father’s House” by recalling what the therapist had told him about those nighttime trips to Freehold: “He said, ‘What you’re doing is that something bad happened, and you’re going back, thinking that you can make it right again. Something went wrong, and you keep going back to see if you can fix it or somehow make it right.’ And I sat there and I said, ‘That is what I’m doing.’ And he said, ‘Well, you can’t.’ ”

Extreme wealth may have satisfied every pink-Cadillac dream, but it did little to chase off the black dog. Springsteen was playing concerts that went nearly four hours, driven, he has said, by “pure fear and self-loathing and self-hatred.” He played that long not just to thrill the audience but also to burn himself out. Onstage, he held real life at bay.

“My issues weren’t as obvious as drugs,” Springsteen said. “Mine were different, they were quieter—just as problematic, but quieter. With all artists, because of the undertow of history and self-loathing, there is a tremendous push toward self-obliteration that occurs onstage. It’s both things: there’s a tremendous finding of the self while also an abandonment of the self at the same time. You are free of yourself for those hours; all the voices in your head are gone. Just gone. There’s no room for them. There’s one voice, the voice you’re speaking in.”

Springsteen’s life in the past two decades has been, from all appearances, notably stable. In 1991, he married Patti Scialfa, a denizen of the Asbury Park music scene who had joined the band as a singer. Scialfa’s father was a real-estate developer, and she had studied music at N.Y.U.

While Springsteen was on the road, I drove to Colts Neck, where he and Patti live on a three-hundred-and-eighty-acre farm. They have three children, two sons and a daughter, and when the kids were small the family lived closer to the shore, in Rumson, New Jersey. Rumson is wealthy in a suburban way. Colts Neck looks more like Middleburg, Virginia. Horsey people live there. So does Queen Latifah. The Springsteens also own houses in Beverly Hills and in Wellington, Florida.

Springsteen is hardly immune to the charms of his own good fortune (“I live high on the hog”), yet Patti, who grew up near him but with a great deal more money, has a grander eye. When they moved to Colts Neck, she hired Rose Tarlow, an interior designer who had worked for their friend David Geffen, to do the house. When I arrived, a security guard led me to a garage complex that had been re-made into a recording studio and a series of sitting rooms. The walls are decorated with photographs of, most conspicuously, Bruce Springsteen; the tables and shelves are heavy on the literature of popular music, with an emphasis on Presley, Dylan, Guthrie, and Springsteen. There’s a big TV, an espresso machine, and a framed walking stick that Presley once owned and, in 1973, shattered in a fit of pique.

Patti Scialfa showed up after a while, trailed by two big, shambly German shepherds. A tall, slender woman in her late fifties with a startling shock of red hair, she was warm and smiling, offering water in the modern way; she also seemed a little nervous. Scialfa, like her husband, enjoys a magnificently cosseted life, but hers is a strange position and she doesn’t often talk about it publicly. At concerts, she performs two microphones to her husband’s left, a perfect vantage point from which to inspect, night after night, the thousands of hungry eyes directed his way. Scialfa has recorded three albums of her own. In the E Street Band, which she joined twenty-eight years ago, she plays acoustic guitar and sings, but, as she told me, “I have to say that my place in the band is more figurative than it is musical.” Onstage, her guitar is barely audible, and she is one of many supporting voices. Yet no one in the crowd is unaware that she is Springsteen’s wife––his “Jersey girl,” his “red-headed woman,” as the songs go––and, at any given theatrical moment onstage, she can flirt, rebuff, swoon, or dance. The E Street Band is an ensemble of characters, as well as musicians, and Scialfa expertly plays her role as Love Interest and Bemused Wife, just as Steve Van Zandt plays his as Best Friend. “Sometimes my frustration comes when I would like to bring something to the table that is more unique,” she said, “but the band, in the context of the band, has no room for that.”

On the last couple of tours, Scialfa has been an intermittent presence. She skips concerts to be with the children: the eldest, Evan, just graduated from Boston College; their daughter, Jessica, is at Duke and rides on an international equestrian circuit; and the youngest, Sam, will be a freshman this fall at Bard College. Being around for the kids has been a priority. “When I was young, I felt really, really vulnerable,” Scialfa said. “So I wanted things to be relaxed and stable and have somebody in the house and make sure they felt supported when they went off to school.” She added, “The hardest part is splitting yourself, the feeling that you’re never doing any one job really well.”

It took some doing to get Springsteen, an “isolationist” by nature, to settle into a real marriage, and resist the urge to dwell only in his music and onstage. “Now I see that two of the best days of my life,” he once told a reporter for Rolling Stone, “were the day I picked up the guitar and the day that I learned how to put it down.”

Scialfa smiled at that. “When you are that serious and that creative, and non-trusting on an intimate level, and your art has given you so much, your ability to create something becomes your medicine,” she said. “It’s the only thing that’s given you that stability, that joy, that self-esteem. And so you are, like, ‘This part of me no one is going to touch.’ When you’re young, that works, because it gets you from A to B. When you get older, when you are trying to have a family and children, it doesn’t work. I think that some artists can be prone to protecting the well that they fetched their inspiration from so well that they are actually protecting malignant parts of themselves, too. You begin to see that something is broken. It’s not just a matter of being the mythological lone wolf; something is broken. Bruce is very smart. He wanted a family, he wanted a relationship, and he worked really, really, really hard at it––as hard as he works at his music.”

I asked Patti how he finally succeeded. “Obviously, therapy,” she said. “He was able to look at himself and battle it out.” And yet none of this has allowed Springsteen to pronounce himself free and clear. “That didn’t scare me,” Scialfa said. “I suffered from depression myself, so I knew what that was about. Clinical depression—I knew what that was about. I felt very akin to him.”

In their early days as a couple, Bruce and Patti’s idea of a perfect vacation was to get in the car and drive to Death Valley, rent a cheap hotel room with no TV and no phone, and just hang out. Now they are more likely to take a trip with the kids or cruise the Mediterranean on David Geffen’s yacht. “I remember when my family became pretty wealthy, and some people tried to make us feel bad about being wealthy,” she said. “Here’s the bottom line. If your art is intact, your art is intact. Who wrote ‘Anna Karenina’? Tolstoy? He was an aristocrat! Did that make his work any less true? If you are lucky enough to have a real talent and you’ve fed it and mined it and protected it and been vigilant about it, can you lose it? Well, you can lose it by sitting outside and drinking Ripple! It doesn’t have to be the high life.”

As Springsteen sees it, the creative talent has always been nurtured by the darker currents of his psyche, and wealth is no guarantee of bliss. “I’m thirty years in analysis!” he said. “Look, you cannot underestimate the fine power of self-loathing in all of this. You think, I don’t like anything I’m seeing, I don’t like anything I’m doing, but I need to change myself, I need to transform myself. I do not know a single artist who does not run on that fuel. If you are extremely pleased with yourself, nobody would be fucking doing it! Brando would not have acted. Dylan wouldn’t have written ‘Like a Rolling Stone.’ James Brown wouldn’t have gone ‘Unh!’ He wouldn’t have searched that one-beat down that was so hard. That’s a motivation, that element of ‘I need to remake myself, my town, my audience’—the desire for renewal.”

“Wrecking Ball” is as political a record as “What’s Going On?,” “Rage Against the Machine,” or “It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.” After Springsteen’s political run-ins in the eighties, he grew even more engaged with social issues. He sang of AIDS (“Streets of Philadelphia”), dislocation (“The Ghost of Tom Joad”), abandonment (“Spare Parts”), and Iraq (“Last to Die”). He made speeches from the stage about “rendition, illegal wiretapping, voter suppression, no habeas corpus.” For his trouble, he was attacked by Bill O’Reilly, Glenn Beck, and even a Times columnist, John Tierney, who wrote, “The singer who recorded ‘Greetings from Asbury Park’ seems to have made an ideological crossing of the Hudson: ‘Greetings from Central Park West.’ ” In 2004, he campaigned for John Kerry and, in 2008, he was even more enthusiastic about Barack Obama, posting a statement on his Web site saying that Obama “speaks to the America I’ve envisioned in my music for the past 35 years, a generous nation with a citizenry willing to tackle nuanced and complex problems, a country that’s interested in its collective destiny and in the potential of its gathered spirit.” At a concert at the Lincoln Memorial before Obama’s inauguration, Springsteen sang “The Rising” with a gospel choir and, with Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land,” including, at Seeger’s suggestion, the two last, “radical” verses. (“There was a great high wall there / that tried to stop me; / A great big sign there / Said private property; / But on the other side / It didn’t say nothing; / That side was made for you and me.”)

The songs on “Wrecking Ball” were written before the Occupy Wall Street movement, but they echo its rage against the lack of accountability. “We Are Alive” draws a line between ghosts of oppressed strikers, civil-rights marchers, and workers, while the chorus is a kind of communion among the dead and a call to the living: “We are alive / And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark / Our spirits rise / To carry the fire and light the spark.” For all that, the political vision—in “Wrecking Ball,” as in its predecessors—isn’t really radical. It’s shot through with a liberal insistence that American patriotism has less to do with the primacy of markets than with a Rooseveltian sense of fairness and a communal sense of belonging.

One night, I asked Springsteen what he hoped his political songs would do for people who come to concerts for a good time. He shook his head and said, “They function at the very edges of politics at best, though they try to administer to its center. You have to be satisfied with that. You have to understand it’s a long road, and there have been people doing some version of what we’re doing on this tour going all the way back, and there will be people doing it after us. I think one thing this record tries to do is to remind people that there is a continuity that is passed on from generation to generation, a set of ideas expressed in myriad different ways: books, protests, essays, songs, around the kitchen table. So these ideas are ever-present. And you are a raindrop.”

Springsteen admires Obama for the health-care bill, for rescuing the automobile industry, for the withdrawal from Iraq, for killing Osama bin Laden; he is disappointed in the failure to close Guantánamo and to appoint more champions of economic fairness, and he sees an unseemly friendliness toward corporations—the usual liberal points of praise and dispraise. He’s wary about joining another campaign. “I did it twice because things were so dire,” he said. “It seemed like if I was ever going to spend whatever small political capital I had, that was the moment to do so. But that capital diminishes the more often you do it. While I’m not saying never, and I still like to support the President, you know, it’s something I didn’t do for a long time, and I don’t have plans to be out there every time.”

Springsteen has been faulted for taking himself too seriously, and the microworld around him takes him so seriously that to an outsider it can occasionally seem like a cocoon of piety. But Springsteen can also be funny about himself. Two years ago, on Jimmy Fallon’s show, he agreed to dress up as himself circa “Born to Run”—beard, aviator shades, floppy pimp cap, leather jacket—and went on with Fallon, who was dressed as Neil Young, to sing a mock-serious version of the Willow Smith ditty “Whip My Hair.” It’s hard to imagine, say, Bob Dylan putting on a Bob Dylan work shirt circa “The Times They Are A-Changin’ ” and sending up his younger self. In a more recent show, Fallon, again dressed as Neil Young, again brought out Springsteen, this time dressed in his muscled-up eighties regular-Jersey-guy regalia—complete with sleeveless denim shirt. They sang a duet of the party-song pop duo LMFAO’s “Sexy and I Know It”: “I’m in a Speedo tryin’ t’ tan my cheeks. . . . I’m sexy and I know it!”

As a writer and as a performer, Springsteen is in command of a variety of themes and moods: comic and grandiose, political and mindless. As the tour developed, he altered the set lists so that each show felt specific to the occasion. At the Apollo, he declared that soul music had been the band’s education: “We studied all our subjects. Geography? We learned the exact location of ‘Funky Broadway.’ History? ‘A Change Is Gonna Come.’ Math? ‘99 and a Half Won’t Fucking Do.’ ” In Austin, Springsteen celebrated the centenary of Woody Guthrie’s birth by opening the show with Woody’s itinerant worker’s lament “I Ain’t Got No Home” and closed it with “This Land Is Your Land.”

In Tampa, Springsteen played “American Skin (41 Shots),” which was written in the wake of the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, but was now for Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teen-ager who was killed in Sanford, Florida. On the first of two nights in Philadelphia, Springsteen paid homage to his Shore roots by playing two semi-obscurities from his first years as a recording musician, “Seaside Bar Song” and “Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?” On one foray into the audience, he found Max Weinberg’s ninety-seven-year-old mother and gave her a kiss. The next night, he pulled his eighty-seven-year-old mother, Adele, onto the stage and danced with her to “Dancing in the Dark.” In New Jersey, Springsteen heightened the tribute to Clarence Clemons. During the final song, “Tenth Avenue Freeze Out,” he stopped the music after the line “The Big Man joined the band,” and a film of Clemons rolled on the screens above the stage. (“Man, I could barely stand that,” the percussionist Everett Bradley told me later. “I was crying so bad!”)

At each show, the most striking musical difference between the old E Street Band and the new was the increasing prominence given to Jake Clemons. His playing grew stronger, his willingness to take center stage more pronounced. After a few performances, he was moon-walking across the stage. And yet every time Springsteen paid tribute to Clarence Clemons Jake seemed overcome, pounding his chest with a double tap of respect for his uncle and appreciation of the crowd’s response. “Everyone wants to be part of something bigger than themselves,” Jake said. “A Springsteen show is a lot of things, and it’s partly a religious experience. Maybe he comes from the line of David, a shepherd boy who could play beautiful music, so that the crazy become less crazy and Saul the king finally chills out. Religion is a system of rules and order and expectations, and it unites people in a purpose. There really is a component of Bruce that is supernatural. Bruce is Moses! He led the people out of the land of disco!”

One night, as Springsteen was waiting to perform, I asked how he thought his inner constitution led to his being the artist and performer he is. “I probably worked harder than anybody else I saw,” he said. But there was, he thought, a core psychological component as well: “I searched out something that I needed to do. It’s a job that’s filled with ego and vanity and narcissism, and you need all those things to do it well. But you can’t let those things completely swamp you, either. You need all those things but in relative check. And in relative check for me, if you ask some of my friends or some members of my family, might not be considered in check to them! It’s in relative check as far as people who do what I do. But you need those things, because you are driven by your needs out there—the raw hunger and the raw need of exciting people and exciting yourself into some higher state. People have pursued that throughout the history of civilization. It’s a strange job, and for a lot of people it’s a dangerous job. But those things are at the root of it.”

In May, the tour set off for a three-month run of stadium performances in Europe. In Barcelona, Springsteen was staying in a suite, with a private deck and a Jacuzzi, at the Florida, a glorious hillside hotel overlooking the city; the band and the crew stayed at the Hotel Arts, a five-star hotel on the beach. A caravan of black Mercedes vans whisked the musicians (some band members have their own travelling assistants) to the Olympic Stadium in the afternoon for sound check. Banish any images of rock legend: forget about dissipated drummers slumped in a junkie haze in some stadium locker room, forget roadies hurling televisions and empty bottles of Jack Daniels from hotel balconies into the pool. The Springsteen road show is about as decadent as the Ice Capades. Band members talk about missing their kids, jet lag, Wi-Fi reception at the hotel.

“To be a success these days, you are more likely to be an athlete than a drug addict,” Van Zandt told me. “You go through the phase of drugs and drinking, and if you get through it you see that all the rewards are in longevity. Longevity is more fun than the drugs. Then, there’s the business. For that you need a clean head.”

The upper echelon of the pop-music touring business is, like Silicon Valley, dominated by a small number of enterprises: Lady Gaga, Madonna, U2, Jon Bon Jovi, Jay-Z, and a very few others. The drop-off in scale from there is precipitous. Springsteen is no longer in the Beatlemania phase of the mid-eighties—a period of mini-riots around his hotels—but he is still able to sell out stadiums on the I-95 corridor and other cities in the United States. He is even more popular in Europe. The rhythmic stomping of his fans at Ullevi, a football venue in Gothenburg, in 1985, damaged the foundation, an episode known in Springsteen lore as “the time Bruce broke a stadium.” In Europe, that spirit persists.

The “Wrecking Ball” tour is likely to go on for a year. James Brown played many more shows a year, but he never played so long or with such absolute exertion. Some nights, Springsteen stays a little longer in his dressing room, ginning himself up for all the running, jumping, and screaming, but there is never the thought of taking a pass.

“Once people have bought those tickets, I don’t have that option,” he told me. We were alone in a vast, makeshift dressing room in Barcelona. “Remember, we’re also running a business here, so there is a commercial exchange, and that ticket is my handshake. That ticket is me promising you that it’s gonna be all the way every chance I get. That’s my contract. And ever since I was a young guy I took that seriously.” Although there are nights when, in the dressing room, he feels tapped out, the stage always works its magic: “Suddenly the fatigue disappears. A transformation takes place. That’s what we’re selling. We’re selling that possibility. It’s half a joke: I go out onstage and—snap—‘Are you ready to be transformed?’ What? At a rock show? By a guy with a guitar? Part of it is a goof, and part of it is, Let’s do it, let’s see if we can.”

One kindness that Springsteen has afforded his body is more days off, leaving time for his family, for exercise, for listening to music, watching movies, reading. Lately, he has been consumed with Russian fiction. “It’s compensatory—what you missed the first time around,” he said. “I’m sixty-some, and I think, There are a lot of these Russian guys! What’s all the fuss about? So I was just curious. That was an incredible book: ‘The Brothers Karamazov.’ Then I read ‘The Gambler.’ The social play in the first half was less interesting to me, but the second half, about obsession, was fun. That could speak to me. I was a big John Cheever fan, and so when I got into Chekhov I could see where Cheever was coming from. And I was a big Philip Roth fan, so I got into Saul Bellow, ‘Augie March.’ These are all new connections for me. It’d be like finding out now that the Stones covered Chuck Berry!”

Springsteen was sitting near a low table covered with picks, capos, harmonicas, and sheets of paper with lists of songs written in thick black marker. After sound check, he tries to imagine that night’s performance. The rest of the band and the crew are down the hall at “catering”—an improvised commissary. Tonight, the menu is veal shank, grouper, and various vegetarian options, to say nothing of half a dozen kinds of salad and a pâtisserie of desserts. (“Did you try that Spanish banana thingy? Amazing!”) The band members wait for Springsteen to distribute the night’s set list. The old-timers are calm, but the newer members wait with a measure of anxiety. “I’m always flipping out, having nightmares that he’s gonna call something that I never even heard of fifteen minutes before we go onstage,” Jake Clemons said.

Thousands of fans, many of whom had been waiting outside since morning, were allowed to enter the stadium grounds at six o’clock for a show that would not begin until ten. I noticed a few young Spaniards carrying a sign, in English, reading, “Bruce, Thanks for Making Our Lives Better.” I tried to imagine a sign like that for—whom? Lou Reed? AC/DC? Bon Jovi? (“Richie Sambora, Thanks for making our lives better.” Doubtful.) The ultra-sincere interchange between Springsteen and his fans, which looks treacly to the uninitiated and the uninterested, is what distinguishes him and his performances. Forty years on, and an hour before going onstage yet again, he was trying to make sense of that transaction.

“You are isolated, yet you desire to talk to somebody,” Springsteen said. “You are very disempowered, so you seek impact, recognition that you are alive and that you exist. We hope to send people out of the building we play in with a slightly more enhanced sense of what their options might be, emotionally, maybe communally. You empower them a little bit, they empower you. It’s all a battle against the futility and the existential loneliness! It may be that we are all huddled together around the fire and trying to fight off that sense of the inevitable. That’s what we do for one another.

“I try to put on the kind of show that the kid in the front row is going to come to and never forget,” he went on. “Our effort is to stay with you, period, to have you join us and to allow us to join you for the ride—the whole ride. That’s what we’ve been working on the whole time, and this show is the latest installment, and, in many ways, it’s the most complicated installment, because in many ways it has to do with the end of that ride. There are kids who are coming to the show who will never have seen the band with Clarence Clemons in it or Danny Federici—people who were in the band for thirty years. So our job is to honor the people who stood on that stage by putting on the best show we’ve ever put on. To do that, you’ve got to acknowledge your losses and your defeats as well as your victories. There is a finiteness to it, though the end may be a long time away. We end the night with a party of sorts, but it’s not an uncomplicated party. It’s a life party—that’s what we try to deliver up.”

A couple of weeks earlier, one of Springsteen’s beloved aunts died. And now, the day before the first concert in Barcelona, Mary Van Zandt, Steve’s mother, died, in Red Bank. “When I was a child, deaths came regularly,” Springsteen said. “Then there’s a period, unless accidents happen, death doesn’t happen, and then you reach a period where it just happens regularly again. We’ve entered that part.”

A little while later, having changed from his regular jeans to his stage jeans, Springsteen walked with the band through a stadium tunnel and toward the stage. The last thing he saw before heading to the mike and a blast of stage lights was a sign taped to the top step that read “Barcelona.” A few years ago, at an arena show in Auburn Hills, he kept greeting the crowd with shouts of “Hello, Ohio!” Finally, Van Zandt pulled him aside and told him they were in Michigan.

Springsteen glanced at the step and stepped into the spotlight.

“Hola, Barcelona!” he cried out to a sea of forty-five thousand people. “Hola, Catalunya!” ♦

For a moment, he was obscured by the Havana night. It was as if he were invisible, as he had been before coming to Cuba, in the midst of revolution. Then a burst of floodlights illuminated him: William Alexander Morgan, the great Yankee comandante. He was standing, with his back against a bullet-pocked wall, in an empty moat surrounding La Cabaña—an eighteenth-century stone fortress, on a cliff overlooking Havana Harbor, that had been converted into a prison. Flecks of blood were drying on the patch of ground where Morgan’s friend had been shot, moments earlier. Morgan, who was thirty-two, blinked into the lights. He faced a firing squad.

The gunmen gazed at the man they had been ordered to kill. Morgan was nearly six feet tall, and had the powerful arms and legs of someone who had survived in the wild. With a stark jaw, a pugnacious nose, and scruffy blond hair, he had the gallant look of an adventurer in a movie serial, of a throwback to an earlier age, and photographs of him had appeared in newspapers and magazines around the world. The most alluring images—taken when he was fighting in the mountains, with Fidel Castro and Che Guevara—showed Morgan, with an untamed beard, holding a Thompson submachine gun. Though he was now shaved and wearing prison garb, the executioners recognized him as the mysterious Americano who once had been hailed as a hero of the revolution. 

It was March 11, 1961, two years after Morgan had helped to overthrow the dictator Fulgencio Batista, bringing Castro to power. The revolution had since fractured, its leaders devouring their own, like Saturn, but the sight of Morgan before a firing squad was a shock. In 1957, when Castro was still widely seen as fighting for democracy, Morgan had travelled from Florida to Cuba and headed into the jungle, joining a guerrilla force. In the words of one observer, Morgan was “like Holden Caulfield with a machine gun.” He was the only American in the rebel army and the sole foreigner, other than Guevara, an Argentine, to rise to the army’s highest rank, comandante. 

After the revolution, Morgan’s role in Cuba aroused even greater fascination, as the island became enmeshed in the larger battle of the Cold War. An American who knew Morgan said that he had served as Castro’s “chief cloak-and-dagger man,” and Time called him Castro’s “crafty, U.S.-born double agent.” 

Now Morgan was charged with conspiring to overthrow Castro. The Cuban government claimed that Morgan had actually been working for U.S. intelligence—that he was, in effect, a triple agent. Morgan denied the allegations, but even some of his friends wondered who he really was, and why he had come to Cuba. 

Before Morgan was led outside La Cabaña, an inmate asked him if there was anything he could do for him. Morgan replied, “If you ever get out of here alive, which I doubt you will, try to tell people my story.” Morgan grasped that more than his life was at stake: the Cuban regime would distort his role in the revolution, if not excise it from the public record, and the U.S. government would stash documents about him in classified files, or “sanitize” them by concealing passages with black ink. He would be rubbed out—first from the present, then from the past.

The head of the firing squad shouted, “Attention!” The gunmen raised their Belgian rifles. Morgan feared for his wife, Olga—whom he had met in the mountains—and for their two young daughters. He had always managed to bend the forces of history, and he had made a last-minute plea to communicate with Castro. Morgan had believed that the man he once called his “faithful friend” would never kill him. But now the executioners were cocking their guns. 

THE FIRST TRICK 

When Morgan arrived in Havana, in December, 1957, he was propelled by the thrill of a secret. He made sure that he wasn’t being followed as he moved surreptitiously through the neon-lit capital. Advertised as the “Playland of the Americas,” Havana offered one temptation after another: the Sans Souci night club, where, on outdoor stages, dancers with frank hips swayed under the stars to the cha-cha; the Hotel Capri, whose slot machines spat out American silver dollars; and the Tropicana, where guests such as Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando enjoyed lavish revues featuring the Diosas de Carne, or “flesh goddesses.” 

Morgan, then a pudgy twenty-nine-year-old, tried to appear as just another man of leisure. He wore a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar white suit with a white shirt, and a new pair of shoes. “I looked like a real fat-cat tourist,” he later joked. 

But, according to members of Morgan’s inner circle, and to the unpublished account of a close friend, he avoided the glare of the city’s night life, making his way along a street in Old Havana, near a wharf that offered a view of La Cabaña, with its drawbridge and moss-covered walls. Morgan paused by a telephone booth, where he encountered a Cuban contact named Roger Rodríguez. A raven-haired student radical with a thick mustache, Rodríguez had once been shot by police during a political demonstration, and he was a member of a revolutionary cell.

Most tourists remained oblivious of the many iniquities of Cuba, where people often lived without electricity or running water. Graham Greene, who published “Our Man in Havana” in 1958, later recalled, “I enjoyed the louche atmosphere of Batista’s city and I never stayed long enough to become aware of the sad political background of arbitrary imprisonment and torture.” Morgan, however, had briefed himself on Batista, who had seized power in a coup, in 1952: how the dictator liked sitting in his palace, eating sumptuous meals and watching horror films, and how he tortured and killed dissidents, whose bodies were sometimes dumped in fields, with their eyes gouged out or their crushed testicles stuffed in their mouths. 

Morgan and Rodríguez resumed walking through Old Havana, and began a furtive conversation. Morgan was rarely without a cigarette, and typically communicated through a haze of smoke. He didn’t know Spanish, but Rodríguez spoke broken English. They had previously met in Miami, becoming friends, and Morgan believed that he could trust him. Morgan confided that he planned to sneak into the Sierra Maestra, a mountain range on Cuba’s remote southeastern coast, where revolutionaries had taken up arms against the regime. He intended to enlist with the rebels, who were commanded by Fidel Castro. 

The name of Batista’s mortal enemy carried the jolt of the forbidden. On November 25, 1956, Castro, a thirty-year-old lawyer and the illegitimate son of a prosperous landowner, had launched from Mexico an amphibious invasion of Cuba, along with eighty-one self-styled commandos, including Che Guevara. After their battered wooden ship ran aground, Castro and his men waded through chest-deep waters, and came ashore in a swamp whose tangled vegetation tore their skin. Batista’s Army soon ambushed them, and Guevara was shot in the neck. (He later wrote, “I immediately began to wonder what would be the best way to die, now that all seemed lost.”) Only a dozen or so rebels, including the wounded Guevara and Castro’s younger brother, Raúl, escaped, and, exhausted and delirious with thirst—one drank his own urine—they fled into the steep jungles of the Sierra Maestra.

Morgan told Rodríguez that he had been tracking the progress of the uprising. After Batista mistakenly declared that Castro had died in the ambush, Castro allowed a Times correspondent, Herbert Matthews, to be escorted into the Sierra Maestra. A close friend of Ernest Hemingway, Matthews longed not merely to cover world-changing events but to make them, and he was captivated by the tall rebel leader, with his wild beard and burning cigar. “The personality of the man is overpowering,” Matthews wrote. “Here was an educated, dedicated fanatic, a man of ideals, of courage.” Matthews concluded that Castro had “strong ideas of liberty, democracy, social justice, the need to restore the Constitution.” On February 24, 1957, the story appeared on the paper’s front page, intensifying the rebellion’s romantic aura. Matthews later put it this way: “A bell tolled in the jungles of the Sierra Maestra.”

Yet why would an American be willing to die for Cuba’s revolution? When Rodríguez pressed Morgan, he indicated that he wanted to be both on the side of good and on the edge of danger, but he also wanted something else: revenge. Morgan said that he had an American buddy who had travelled to Havana and been killed by Batista’s soldiers. Later, Morgan provided more details to others in Cuba: his friend, a man named Jack Turner, had been caught smuggling weapons to the rebels, and was “tortured and tossed to the sharks by Batista.”

Morgan told Rodríguez that he had already made contact with another revolutionary, who had arranged to sneak him into the mountains. Rodríguez was taken aback: the supposed rebel was an agent of Batista’s secret police. Rodríguez warned Morgan that he’d fallen into a trap. 

Rodríguez, fearing for Morgan’s life, offered to help him. He could not transport Morgan to the Sierra Maestra, but he could take him to the camp of a rebel group in the Escambray Mountains, which cut across the central part of the country. These guerrillas were opening a new front, and Castro welcomed them to the “common struggle.”

Morgan set out with Rodríguez and a driver on the two-hundred-and-seventeen mile journey. As Aran Shetterly details in his incisive biography “The Americano” (2007), the car soon arrived at a military roadblock. A soldier peered inside at Morgan in his gleaming suit, the only outfit that he seemed to own. Morgan knew what would happen if he were seized—as Guevara said, “in a revolution, one wins or dies”—and he had prepared a cover story, in which he was an American businessman on his way to see coffee plantations. After hearing the tale, the soldier let them pass, and Morgan and his conspirators roared up the road, up into the Escambray, where the air became cooler and thinner, and where the three-thousand-foot peaks had an eerie purple tint.

Morgan was taken to a safe house to rest, then driven to a mountainside near the town of Banao. A peasant shepherded Morgan and Rodríguez through vines and banana leaves until they reached a remote clearing, flanked by steep slopes. The peasant made a birdlike sound, which rang through the forest and was reciprocated by a distant whistle. A sentry emerged, and Morgan and Rodríguez were led to a campsite strewn with water basins and hammocks and a few antiquated rifles. Morgan could count only thirty or so men, many of whom appeared barely out of high school and had the emaciated, straggly look of shipwreck survivors. 

The rebels regarded Morgan uncertainly. Max Lesnik, a Cuban journalist in charge of the organization’s propaganda, soon met up with the group, and recalls wondering if Morgan was “some kind of agent from the C.I.A.” 

Since the Spanish-American War, the U.S. had often meddled in Cuban affairs, treating the island like a colony. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had blindly supported Batista—believing that he would “deal with the Commies,” as he put it to Vice-President Richard Nixon—and the C.I.A. had activated operatives throughout the island. In 1954, in a classified report, an American general advised that if the U.S. was to survive the Cold War it needed to “learn to subvert, sabotage, and destroy our enemies by more clever, more sophisticated, and more effective methods than those used against us.” The C.I.A. went so far as to hire a renowned magician, John Mulholland, to teach operatives sleight of hand and misdirection. Mulholland produced two illustrated manuals, which referred to covert operations as “tricks.” 

As the C.I.A. tried to assess the threat to Batista, its operatives attempted to penetrate rebel forces in the mountains. Among other things, agents were believed to have recruited, or posed as, reporters. Mulholland advised operatives that “even more practice is needed to act a lie skillfully than is required to tell one.” 

The rebels also had to be sure that Morgan was not a K.G.B. operative, or a mercenary working for Batista’s military intelligence. In the Sierra Maestra, Castro had recently discovered that a peasant within his ranks was an Army informant. The peasant, after being summoned, dropped to his knees, begging that the revolution take care of his children. Then he was shot in the head.

Morgan was now brought to see the commander of the rebel group, Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo. Twenty-three years old, soft-spoken, and bone-thin, Menoyo had a long, handsome face that was shielded by dark spectacles and a beard, giving him the look of a fugitive. The C.I.A. later noted, in its file on him, that he was an intelligent, capable young man who would not break “under normal interrogating techniques.”

As a boy, Menoyo had emigrated from Spain—a lisp was faintly present when he spoke Spanish—and he had inherited his family’s militant posture toward tyranny. His oldest brother had been killed, at the age of sixteen, fighting the Fascists during the Spanish Civil War. His other brother, who had also come to Cuba, had been gunned down while leading a doomed assault on Batista’s palace, in 1957. Menoyo had identified the body at a Havana morgue before heading into the mountains. “I wanted to continue the fight in my brother’s name,” he recalls.

Through a translator, Morgan told Menoyo his story about wanting to avenge a buddy’s death. Morgan said that he had served in the U.S. Army and was skilled in martial arts and hand-to-hand combat, and that he could train the inexperienced rebels in guerrilla warfare. There was more to fighting than shooting a rifle, Morgan argued; as he later said, with the right tactics they could put “the fear of God” in the enemy. To demonstrate his prowess, Morgan borrowed a knife and flicked it at a tree at least twenty yards away. It hit the target so squarely that some rebels gasped. 

That evening, they argued over whether Morgan could stay. Morgan seemed simpático—“like a Cuban,” as Lesnik puts it. But many rebels, fearing that he was an infiltrator, wanted to send Morgan back to Havana. The group’s chief of intelligence, Roger Redondo, recalls, “We did everything possible to make him leave.” During the next several days, they marched him endlessly up and down the mountainsides. Morgan was so fat, one rebel joked, that he had to be C.I.A.

Morgan, famished and fatigued, repeatedly hollered a few Spanish words that he had learned, “No soy mulo”—“I’m not a mule!” At one point, the rebels led him into a patch of prickly poisonous shrubs, which stung like wasps and caused his chest and face to become grievously inflamed. Morgan could no longer sleep at night. When he removed his sweaty white shirt, Redondo recalls, “We pitied him. He was so fair-skinned and had turned such an angry red.”

Morgan’s body also offered clues to a violent past. He had burn marks on his right arm, and a nearly foot-long scar ran across his chest, suggesting that someone had slashed him with a knife. There was a tiny scar under his chin, another by his left eye, and several on his left foot. It was as if he had already suffered years of hardship in the jungle.

Morgan endured whatever ordeal the rebels subjected him to, shedding thirty-five pounds along the way. He later wrote that he had become unrecognizable: “I weigh only—165 lbs and have a beard.” Redondo says, “The gringo was tough, and the armed men of the Escambray came to admire his persistence.”

Several weeks after Morgan arrived, a lookout noticed something moving amid distant cedars and tropical plants. Using binoculars, he made out six men, in khaki uniforms and wide-brimmed hats, carrying Springfield rifles. A Batista Army patrol.

Most of the rebels had never faced combat. Morgan later described them as “doctors, lawyers, farmers, chemists, boys, students, and old men banded together.” The lookout sounded the alarm, and Menoyo ordered everyone to take up positions around the camp. The rebels were not to fire, Menoyo explained, unless he said so. Morgan crouched beside Menoyo, holding one of the few semi-automatic rifles. As the soldiers crept closer, a shot rang out. 

It was Morgan. 

Menoyo cursed under his breath as both sides began shooting. Bullets split trees in half, and a bitter-tasting fog of smoke drifted over the mountainside. The thunderous sounds of the guns made it nearly impossible to communicate. A Batista soldier was hit in the shoulder, a scarlet stain seeping through his uniform, and he tumbled down the mountain like a boulder. The commander of the Army patrol retrieved the wounded soldier and, along with the rest of his men, retreated into the wilderness, leaving a trail of blood.

In the sudden quiet, Menoyo turned to Morgan and yelled, “Why the hell did you fire?” 

Morgan, when he was told in English what Menoyo was saying, seemed baffled. “I thought you said to shoot when I saw their eyes,” he said. No one had translated Menoyo’s original command.

Morgan had made a mistake, but it had only hastened an inevitable battle. Menoyo told Morgan and the others to clear out: hundreds of Batista’s soldiers would soon be upon them. 

The men stuffed their belongings into backpacks made from sugar sacks. Menoyo took with him a medallion that his mother had given him, depicting the Immaculate Conception. Morgan tucked away his own mementos: photographs of a young boy and a young girl. The rebels divided into two groups, and Morgan set out with Menoyo and twenty others, marching for more than a hundred miles through the mountains. 

They usually moved during the night, then, at dawn, found a sheltered spot and ate what little food they had, taking turns sleeping while sentries kept watch. Morgan, who called one of his semi-automatic rifles his niño, always kept a weapon nearby. As darkness returned, the men resumed marching, listening to the sounds of woodpeckers and barking dogs and their own exhausted breathing. Their bodies slackened from hunger, and beards covered their faces like jungle growth. When a nineteen-year-old rebel fell and broke his foot, Morgan supported him, making sure that he was not left behind. 

One morning during the march, a rebel was scrounging for food when he spotted about two hundred Batista soldiers in a nearby valley. The rebels faced annihilation. As panic spread, Morgan helped Menoyo devise a plan. They would prepare an ambush, hiding behind a series of large stones, in a U formation. It was critical, Morgan said, to leave an escape route. The rebels crouched behind the stones, feeling the warmth of the earth against their bodies, holding their rifles steady against their cheeks. Earlier, some of the young men had professed cheerful indifference to death, but their brio vanished as they confronted the prospect. 

Morgan braced himself for the fight. He had inserted himself into a foreign conflict, and now everything was at risk. His predicament was akin to that of Robert Jordan, the American protagonist of “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” who, while aiding the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, must blow up a bridge: “He had only one thing to do and that was what he should think about. . . . To worry was as bad as to be afraid. It simply made things more difficult.” 

Batista’s soldiers approached the ridge. Though the rebels could hear branches snapping under the soldiers’ boots, Menoyo told his men to hold fire, making sure that Morgan understood this time. Soon, the enemy soldiers were so close that Morgan could see the barrels of their guns. “Patria o Muerte,” Castro liked to say—“Fatherland or Death.” Finally, Menoyo gave the signal to shoot. Amid the screaming, blood, and chaos, some of the rebels fell back, but, as Shetterly wrote, “they noticed Morgan out in front of everyone, moving ahead, completely focused on the fight.” 

Batista’s soldiers started to flee. “They folded,” Armando Fleites, a medic with the rebels, recalls. “It was a complete victory.”

More than a dozen of Batista’s soldiers were wounded or killed. The rebels, who took the dead soldiers’ guns, had not lost a single man, and afterward they enlisted Morgan to teach them better ways to fight. One former rebel recalls, “He trained me in guerrilla warfare—how to handle different weapons, how to plant bombs.” Morgan instructed the men in judo and how to breathe underwater using a hollow reed. “There were so many things that he knew that we didn’t,” the rebel says. Morgan even knew some Japanese and German.

He learned Spanish, becoming a full member of the group, which was dubbed the Second National Front of the Escambray. Like the other rebels, Morgan took an oath to “fight and defend with my life this little piece of free territory,” to “guard all the war secrets,” and to “denounce traitors.” Morgan rose quickly, first commanding half a dozen men, then leading a larger column and, finally, presiding over several square kilometres of occupied territory. 

As Morgan won more battles, the news of his curious presence began filtering out. A Cuban rebel radio station reported that rebels “led by an American” had killed forty Batista soldiers. Another broadcast hailed a “Yankee fighting for the liberty of Cuba.” The Miami newspaper Diario Las Américas stated that the American had been a “member of the ‘Rangers’ who landed in Normandy and opened the way to the Allied forces by destroying the Nazi installations on the French coast before D Day.”

U.S. and Cuban intelligence agents also began picking up chatter about a Yankee commando. In the summer of 1958, the C.I.A. reported whispers of a rebel, “identified only as ‘El Americano,’ ” who had played a critical role in “planning and carrying out guerrilla activities,” and who had virtually wiped out a Batista unit while leading his men in an ambush. An informant from a Cuban revolutionary group told the F.B.I. that El Americano was Morgan. Another said that Morgan had “risked his life many times” to save the rebels, and was considered “quite a hero among these forces for bravery and daring.” The reports eventually set off a scramble among U.S. government agencies—including the C.I.A., the Secret Service, the State Department, Army intelligence, and the F.B.I.—to determine who William Alexander Morgan was, and whom he was working for.

THE SECRET DOSSIER

J. Edgar Hoover was feeling tremors of instability. First, there was his heart: in 1958, he had suffered a minor attack, at the age of sixty-three. The head of the F.B.I., Hoover was obsessed with his privacy, and kept the incident largely to himself, but he began a relentless diet-and-exercise regimen, disciplining his body with the same force of will that had eradicated a childhood stutter. He instructed the bureau’s research-and-analysis section to inform him of any scientific advancement that might extend the human life span.

Compounding Hoover’s unease was that “infernal little Cuban republic,” as Theodore Roosevelt had described it. Hoover warned his agents that the growing number of Castro followers in the U.S. “may pose a threat to the internal security” of the country, and he had ordered his agents to infiltrate their organizations. 

Although Hoover rarely travelled abroad, he wanted to transform the F.B.I. into an international spy apparatus, building upon the vast network that he had created within the U.S., which trafficked in raw history: wiretapped conversations, surveillance photographs, papers from garbage bins, intercepted cables, gossip from ex-lovers. 

The U.S. intelligence branches had not yet turned up evidence that Castro or his followers were Communists, and, given Batista’s brutality, some American officials were developing a soft stance toward the rebels. The C.I.A. officer in charge of Caribbean operations later acknowledged, “My staff and I were all Fidelistas.” 

But Hoover remained vigilant: of all the enemies that he had hunted, he considered the agents of Communism the “Masters of Deceit,” as he called his 1958 best-selling book about them. These plotters had hidden streams of information, and they mutated, like viruses, in order to slip past a host’s defenses; Hoover was determined to stop them from infiltrating an island just south of Florida. A source inside the U.S. Embassy in Havana had informed him that Batista’s hold on the country was “weakening.” Now Hoover was receiving reports of a wild gringo up in the mountains. Was Morgan a Soviet sleeper agent? A C.I.A. operative in a cover posture? Or one who had gone rogue?

After peering into so many lives, Hoover understood that virtually everyone has secrets. Scribbled in a diary. Recorded on a cassette. Buried in a safe-deposit box. A secret may be, as Don DeLillo has written, “something vitalizing.” But it can also cut you down at any moment.

By late 1958, Hoover had unleashed a team of G-men to figure out what Morgan might he hiding. One of them eventually knocked on the door of a large Colonial house in the Old West End of Toledo, Ohio. A distinguished-looking gentleman greeted him. It was Morgan’s father, Alexander, a retired budget director of a utility company and, as his son once described him, a “solid Republican.” He was married to a slim, devout woman, Loretta, who was known as Miss Cathedral, for her involvement in the Catholic church down the street. In addition to their son, they had a daughter, Carroll. Morgan’s father told the F.B.I. agent that he had not heard from his son, whom he called Bill, since he disappeared. But he provided a good deal of information about Morgan, and this, combined with F.B.I. interviews of other relatives and associates, helped Hoover and his spies piece together a startling profile of the Yankee rebel. 

Morgan should have been a quintessential American, a shining product of Midwestern values and a rising middle class. He attended Catholic school and initially earned high marks. (His I.Q. test showed “superior intelligence.”) He loved the outdoors and was a dedicated Boy Scout, receiving the organization’s highest award, in 1941. Years later, he wrote to his parents, “You . . . have done all that is possible to bring up your children with love of God and country.” Wildly energetic, he always seemed to be chattering, earning the nickname Gabby. “He was so likable,” his sister told me. “He could sell you anything.”

But Morgan was also a misfit. He failed to make the football team, and his constant banter exposed a seam of insecurity. He disliked school and often slipped away to read stories of adventure, especially tales about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, filling his mind with places far more exotic than the neighborhood of cropped lawns and boxy houses outside his bedroom window. His mother once said that Morgan had a “very, very vivid imagination,” and that he had brought his fancies to life, constructing, among other things, a “diving helmet” worthy of Jules Verne. He rarely showed “fear of anything,” and once had to be stopped from jumping off the roof with a homemade parachute.

U.S. Army intelligence officials also investigated Morgan, preparing a dossier on him. (The dossier, along with hundreds of other declassified documents from the C.I.A., the F.B.I., the Army, and the State Department, was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and through the National Archives.) In the Army’s psychological assessment, a military-intelligence analyst stated that the young Morgan “seemed to be fairly well adjusted to society.” But, by the time he was a teen-ager, his resistance to the strictures around him, and to those who wanted to pound him into shape, had reached a feverish state. As his mother put it, he had decided that, if he would never belong in Toledo, he would embrace exile, venturing “out in the world himself.” 

In the summer of 1943, at the age of fifteen, Morgan ran away. His mother later gave a report to the Red Cross about her son, saying, “Shocked is the mild word for it. . . for he had never done anything like this before.” Although Morgan returned home a few days later, he soon stole his father’s car and “took off” again, as he later put it, blowing through a red light before the police caught him. He was consigned to a detention center, but he slipped out a window and vanished again. He ended up in Chicago, where he joined the Ringling Brothers circus. Ten days later, his father found him taking care of the elephants, and brought him home. 

In the ninth grade, Morgan dropped out of school and began roaming the country, hopping buses and freighters; he earned money as a punch-press operator, a grocery clerk, a ranch hand, a coal loader, a movie-theatre usher, and a seaman in the Merchant Marine. His father seemed resigned to his son’s fitfulness, telling him in a letter, “Get as much adventure as you can and we will be glad to see you whenever you decide you want to come home.”

Morgan later explained that he had not been unhappy at home—his parents had given him and his sister “anything that we wanted”—and had fled only because he longed “to see new places.”

His mother believed that he had a mythic image of himself, and “always seemed to yearn to be a big shot,” but, given his “super affectionate nature,” she doubted that “he has really meant to worry or hurt us.”

Nevertheless, Morgan increasingly took up with “the wrong kind of gangs of boys,” as he later called them, and got in scrapes with the law. While still a minor, he and some friends stole a stranger’s car, temporarily tying up the driver; he was also investigated for carrying a concealed weapon. 

Nobody—not his parents, not the F.B.I., not the military-intelligence analyst—could unravel the mystery of Morgan’s antisocial behavior; it remained forever encrypted, an unbreakable code. His mother wondered whether something had happened to him during her pregnancy, lamenting, “That boy hasn’t given me a moment’s peace. . . . That’s why my hair is gray.” His father told the F.B.I. that perhaps his son needed to see one of those head doctors. A psychiatrist, cited by Army intelligence, speculated that Morgan was “driven along a course of self-destruction in order to satisfy his neurotic need for punishment.”

Yet it was possible to see Morgan, with his brooding blue eyes and cigarette perpetually clamped between his teeth, as heralding a new social type: a beatnik, a rolling stone. A friend of Morgan’s once told a reporter, “Jack Kerouac was still imagining life on the road while Morgan was out there living it.”

Morgan’s personality—“nomadic, egocentric, impulsive, and utterly irresponsible,” as Hoover’s agents put it—also had some similarities with that of a middle-class teen-ager thousands of miles away. In 1960, a conservative American journalist observed, “Like Fidel Castro, though on a lesser scale, Morgan was a superannuated juvenile delinquent.” 

Hoover and the F.B.I. discovered that, contrary to press accounts, Morgan had not served during the Second World War. Envisaging himself as a modern Sinbad—his other nickname—he had tried to enlist but was turned away, because he was too young. It was not until August, 1946, when the war was over and he was finally eighteen, that he joined the Army. After receiving orders that he would be deployed to Japan, in December, he cried in front of his mother for the first time in years, betraying that, despite his toughness, he was still just a teen-ager. He boarded a train for California, where he had a layover at a base, and on the way he sent his parents a telegram: 



Have surprise—married yesterday 12:30 am to Darlene Edgerton. Am happy—will write or call soon as possible. Don’t worry or get excited.




He had sat beside her on the train, in his starched uniform. “He was tall and handsome and so magnetic,” Edgerton, who is now eighty-seven and blind, recalls. “Truthfully, I was coming home to marry someone else, and we just hit it off and so we stopped off in Reno and got married.” They had known each other for only twenty-four hours and spent two days in a hotel before getting back on a train. When they reached California, Morgan reported to the base and left for Japan. “What young people will do,” Edgerton says. 

With Morgan stationed in Japan, the marriage dissolved after a year and a half, and Edgerton received an annulment—though even after she married another man she kept a letter from Morgan stashed away, which she occasionally unfolded, flattening the edges with her fingers, and read again, stirred by the memory of the comet-like figure who had briefly blazed into her life. 

Morgan was crestfallen by the end of the relationship, but his mother told the Red Cross, “Knowing Bill, I am sure if he had an opportunity to date other girls he would soon forget this present love.” 

Indeed, Morgan took up with Setsuko Takeda, a German-Japanese night-club hostess in Kyoto, and got her pregnant. When Takeda was about to give birth to their son, in the fall of 1947, he could not get a leave, and so he did what he had always done: he ran off. He was arrested for being AWOL, and, while in custody, he claimed that he needed to see Takeda—she was suicidally distraught after being harassed by another soldier. With the aid of a Chinese national who was also locked up, Morgan overpowered a military-police officer and stole his .45. “Morgan told me not to move,” the officer later testified. “He told me to take off my clothes. Then he told the Chinaman to tie me up.” Wearing the guard’s uniform and carrying his gun, Morgan escaped in the middle of the night. 

A military search party located Takeda, and she led authorities to a house where Morgan had said he would wait for her. When she saw Morgan in the rear of the building, she threw her arms around him. One of the officers, seeing the gun in his hand, screamed, “Drop it!” Morgan hesitated, then, like a character in a dime novel, spun the pistol on his finger, so that the butt faced the officer, and handed it over. “It didn’t take you long to get here,” Morgan said, and asked for a cigarette.

On January 15, 1948, at the age of nineteen, Morgan was sentenced by a court-martial to five years in prison. “I guess I got what was coming to me,” he said.

His mother, in her statement to the Red Cross, pleaded for help: “I sincerely want him to be a boy that I can justly be proud of, not one to hang my head in shame for having given him birth.”

Morgan was eventually transferred to a federal prison in Michigan. He enrolled in a class on American history; studied Japanese and German, the languages Takeda spoke; attended “religious instruction classes”; and sang in the church choir. In a progress report, a prison official wrote, “The Chaplain has noticed that inmate Morgan has developed a sense of social responsibility” and “is doing everything possible to improve himself and be an asset to society.”

Morgan was released early, on April 11, 1950. Though he had once hoped to reunite with Takeda and their son, the relationship had been severed. Morgan eventually moved to Florida, where he took a job in a carnival, as a fire swallower, and mastered the use of knives. He began a romance with the carnival’s snake charmer, Ellen May Bethel. A small, tempestuous woman with black hair and green eyes, she was “gorgeous,” a relative says. In the spring of 1955, Morgan and Bethel had a child, Anne. They were married several months later, and in 1957 they had a son, Bill. 

Morgan struggled to be an “asset to society,” but he seemed trapped by his past. He was an ex-con and a dishonorably discharged soldier—a stain that he tried, futilely, to expunge from his record. Morgan later told a friend that, during this period, “he was nothing.” 

According to an F.B.I. informant, Morgan went to work for the Mafia, running errands for Meyer Lansky, the diminutive Jewish gangster known as Little Man. In addition to overseeing rackets in the United States, Lanksy had become the kingpin of Havana, controlling many of its biggest casinos and night clubs. A Mob associate once described how Lansky “took Batista straight back to our hotel, opened the suitcases and pointed at the cash. Batista just stared at the money without saying a word. Then he and Meyer shook hands.”

Morgan drifted back to the streets of Ohio, where he became associated with a local crime boss named Dominick Bartone. A gangster whose Mafia ties reputedly went back to the days of Al Capone, Bartone was a hulking man with thick black hair and dark eyes—a “typical hoodlum appearance,” according to his F.B.I. file. He classified people as either “solid” or “suckers.” His rap sheet eventually included convictions for bribery, gun-running, tax evasion, and bank fraud, and he was closely allied with the head of the Teamsters, Jimmy Hoffa, whom he called “the greatest fella in the world.”

One of Morgan’s friends from Ohio described him to me as “solid.” He said, “Do you know what ‘connection’ means? Well, Morgan was connected.” The friend, who said that he had been indicted for racketeering, suddenly grew quiet, then added, “I don’t know if you’re with the F.B.I. or the C.I.A.”

Some members of the Mafia, including Bartone, prepared for shifting alliances in Cuba, shipping guns to the rebels. Morgan’s father thought that his son first got caught up in the whole Cuba business in 1955, in Florida, when he apparently met Castro, who had travelled there to garner support from the exile community for his upcoming invasion. Two years later, with Castro ensconced in the Sierra Maestra, Morgan left his wife and children in Toledo and began acquiring weapons across the U.S. and arranging for them to be smuggled to the rebels. Perhaps he was motivated by sympathy with the revolution, or by a desire to make money, or simply by an urge to flee domestic responsibilities. Morgan’s father told the F.B.I. that his son had run away “from his problems since he was a youngster,” and that his Cuban escapade was just another example. Morgan, who before heading to Havana had told another gunrunner that he would see him again in Florida “when this damn revolution is over,” later gave his own explanation: “I have lived always looking for something.” 

To this day, some scholars, and even some who knew Morgan, speculate that he was sent to the Escambray by the C.I.A. But, as declassified documents reveal, Hoover and his agents had discovered something more unsettling. Morgan was not working for the agency or a foreign intelligence outfit or the Mob. He was out there on his own.

WHY AM I HERE

“Calling Comandante William Morgan! Comandante William Morgan!”

It was one of his men in the Escambray, speaking on shortwave radio.

“Hear me!” came Morgan’s reply. “Send us reinforcements. We need help—ammunition! If we stay here, they will wipe us out.”

By the summer of 1958, Morgan had endured countless skirmishes. “We were always outnumbered at least thirty to one,” Morgan recalled. “We were a small outfit, but we were mobile and hard-hitting. We became known as the phantoms of the mountains.”

Morgan had witnessed, up close, the cruelties of the Cuban regime: villages ransacked and burned by Batista’s Army, friends shot in the head, a senile man’s tongue cut out. “I know and have seen what these people have been doing,” Morgan said of Batista’s henchmen. “They killed. They tortured. They beat people . . . and done things that don’t have a name.”

On one of his uniform sleeves, Morgan had sewn a U.S. flag. “I was born an American,” he liked to say. 

At night, he often sat by the campfire, where scattered sparks created fleeting constellations, and listened to the rebels share their visions of the revolution. The movement’s various factions—including two other groups in the Escambray and Castro’s forces in the Sierra Maestra—represented an array of ideologies and personal ambitions. The Escambray front advocated a Western-style democracy and was staunchly anti-Communist, a stance that was apparently shared by Fidel Castro, who, unlike his brother Raúl or Che Guevara, had expressed little interest in Marxism-Leninism. In the Sierra Maestra, Castro told a reporter, “I have never been, nor am I now, a Communist. If I were, I would have sufficient courage to proclaim it.”

In the Escambray, Morgan and Menoyo had grown increasingly close. Morgan was older, and almost suicidally brave, like the brother of Menoyo’s who had died in the Batista raid. Morgan addressed Menoyo as “mi jefe y mi hermano”—“my chief and my brother”—and told him about his troubled past. Menoyo felt that Morgan was maturing, as a soldier and a man. “Little by little, William was changing,” Menoyo says. 

In July, after Morgan was promoted to comandante, he wrote a letter to his mother, something that he had not done during his six months in the mountains. Written with a distinctive flourish of dashes, it said, “I know that you neither approve or understand why I am here—even though you are the one person in the world—that I believe understands me—I have been many places—in my life and done many things of which you did not approve—or understand, nor did I understand myself—at the time.” 

He contended with his old sins, acknowledging how much pain he had caused Ellen, his second wife, and their children (“these three who I have hurt deeply”) by abandoning them. “It is hard to understand but I love them very deeply and think of them often,” he wrote. Ellen had filed for divorce, on the ground of desertion. “I don’t expect she has much faith or love for me any more,” Morgan wrote. “And probably she is right.”

Yet he wanted his mother to understand that he was no longer the same person. “I am here with men and boys—who fight for . . . freedom,” he wrote. “And if it should happen that I am killed here—You will know it was not for foolish fancy—or as dad would say a pipe dream.” The friend who had also smuggled weapons to the rebels later told the Palm Beach Post, “He had found his cause in Cuba. He wanted something to believe in. He wanted to have a purpose. He wanted to be someone, not no one.”

Morgan had composed a more philosophical statement about why he had joined the rebels. The essay, titled “Why Am I Here,” said: 



Why do I fight here in this land so foreign to my own? Why did I come here far from my home and family? Why do I worry about these men here in the mountains with me? Is it because they were all close friends of mine? No! When I came here they were strangers to me I could not speak their language or understand their problems. Is it because I seek adventure? No here there is no adventure only the ever existent problems of survive. So why am I here? I am here because I believe that the most important thing for free men to do is to protect the freedom of others. I am here so that my son when he is grown will not have to fight or die in a land not his own, because one man or group of men try to take his liberty from him I am here because I believe that free men should take up arms and stand together and fight and destroy the groups and forces that want to take the rights of people away. 




In his rush to overturn Cuba’s past as well as his own, Morgan often forgot to pause for periods or paragraph breaks. He acknowledged, “I can not say I have always been a good citizen.” But he explained that “being here I can appreciate the way of life that is ours from birth,” and he recounted the seemingly impossible things that he had seen: “Where a boy of nineteen can march 12 hours with a broken foot over country comparable to the american Rockies without complaint. Where a cigarette is smoked by ten men. Where men do without water so that others may drink.” Noting that U.S. policies had propped up Batista, he concluded, “I ask myself why do we support those who would destroy in other lands the ideals which we hold so dear?”

Morgan sent the statement to someone he was sure would sympathize with it: Herbert Matthews. The Times reporter considered Morgan to be “the most interesting figure in the Sierra de Escambray.” Soon after receiving the statement, Matthews published an article about the Second Front and its “tough, uneducated young American” leader, citing a cleaned-up passage from Morgan’s letter. 

Other U.S. newspapers began chronicling the exploits of the “adventurous American,” the “swashbuckling Morgan.” The Washington Post reported that he had become a “daring fellow” by the age of three. The accounts were enough to “make schoolboys drool,” as one newspaper put it. A retired businessman from Ohio later told the Toledo Blade, “He was like a cowboy in an Ernest Hemingway adventure.” Morgan had finally willed his interior fictions into reality. 

One day in the spring of 1958, while Morgan was visiting a guerrilla camp for a meeting of the Second Front’s chiefs of staff, he encountered a rebel he had never seen before: small and slender, with a face shielded by a cap. Only up close was it evident that the rebel was a woman. She was in her early twenties, with dark eyes and tawny skin, and, to conceal her identity, she had cut her curly light-brown hair short and dyed it black. Though she had a delicate beauty, she locked and loaded a gun with the ease of a bank robber. Morgan later said of a pistol that she carried, “She knows how to use it.” 

Her name was Olga Rodríguez. She came from a peasant family, in the central province of Santa Clara, that often went without food. “We were so poor,” Rodríguez recalls. She studied diligently, and was elected class president. Her goal was to become a teacher. She was bright, stubborn, and questioning—as Rodríguez puts it, “always a little different.” Increasingly angered by the Batista regime’s repressiveness, she joined the underground resistance, organizing protests and assembling bombs until, one day, agents from Batista’s secret police appeared in her neighborhood, showing people her photograph. “They were coming to kill me,” Rodríguez recalls. 

When the secret police could not find her, they beat up her brother, heaving him on her parents’ doorstep “like a sack of potatoes,” she says. Her friends begged her to leave Cuba, but she told them, “I will not abandon my country.” In April, 1958, with her appearance disguised and with a tiny .32 pistol tucked in her underwear, she became the first woman to join the rebels in the Escambray. She tended to the wounded and taught rebels to read and write. “I have the spirit of a revolutionary,” she liked to say.

When Morgan met her, he gently teased her about her haircut, pulling down her cap and saying, “Hey, muchacho.” Morgan had arrived at the camp literally riding a white horse, and she had felt her heart go “boom, boom, boom.”

“I am a great romantic, and I was so moved that someone from another country would care enough about my countrymen to fight for them,” she says. Morgan repeatedly sought her out at her camp. She would sometimes prepare him rice and beans (“I’m a guerrilla, not a cook”), and he would complain, “Too fast!” as she spoke, in gunfire-patter Spanish, about the need to hold elections and build hospitals and schools. She seemed unlike so many of the women whom he had impetuously taken up with. Like his mother, she had a deep sense of conviction, and it was her influence, Menoyo says, that furthered “William’s transformation,” though Rodríguez saw it differently: Morgan was not so much changing as discovering who he really was. “I knew William had not always been a saint,” Rodríguez says. “But inside, I could tell, he had a huge heart—one that he had opened not just to me but to my country.” 

Morgan recognized the risk of surrendering to a flight of emotion in the midst of war. The Batista regime had placed a twenty-thousand-dollar bounty on him—“dead or alive,” as Morgan put it. Once, when Morgan and Rodríguez were together, a military plane shut down its engines, so that they could not hear its approach until bombs were falling upon them. “We simply had to dive for cover,” Rodríguez recalls. They barely escaped unharmed. During other bombing raids, they would hold each other, whispering, “Our fates are intertwined.”

When Robert Jordan is overcome with love for a woman during the Spanish Civil War, he fears that they will never experience what ordinary people do: “Not time, not happiness, not fun, not children, not a house, not a bathroom, not a clean pair of pajamas, not the morning paper, not to wake up together, not to wake and know she’s there and that you’re not alone. No. None of that.”

As long as Morgan was fighting in the Escambray, there could be no past or future—only the present. “We could never have peace,” Rodríguez says. “From the beginning, I had this terrible feeling that things would not end well.” Yet the impossibility of their romance only deepened their ardor. Not long after they met, a boy from a nearby village approached Rodríguez in camp, carrying a bunch of purple wildflowers. “Look what the Americano has sent you,” the boy told her. A few days later, the boy appeared again, holding a new bouquet. “From the Americano,” he said. 

As Morgan later told her, they had to “steal time.” In one such moment, a photographer caught them standing in a mountain clearing. In the image, both are wearing fatigues; a rifle is slung over his right shoulder, and she leans on one, as if it were a cane. With their free hands, they are clutching each other. “When I found you, I found everything I can wish for in the world,” he later wrote her. “Only death can separate us.”

“MORGAN WAS KILLED THE PREVIOUS NIGHT IN THE COURSE OF A FIGHT WITH THE CUBAN ARMY.” So read an urgent cable sent from the U.S. Embassy in Havana to Hoover, at F.B.I. headquarters, on September 19, 1958. The Batista regime, which had already leaked the news to the Cuban press, mailed the F.B.I. two photographs of a fractured corpse, shirtless and smeared with blood.

Morgan’s mother was devastated when she heard of the reports. Several weeks later, she received a letter from Cuba, in Morgan’s hand. It said, “The Cuban press last month sent out word that I was dead but as you can tell I am not.” 

Just as Batista’s regime had falsely declared Castro’s death, it had made the mistake of believing its own propaganda about Morgan, becoming trapped in the closed circuit of information that isolates tyrants not only from their countrymen but from reality. Meanwhile, Morgan’s seeming emergence from the dead, like one of Mulholland’s magical feats, created a potent counter-illusion: that he was indestructible.

In October, Che Guevara arrived in the Escambray, with a hundred or so ghostly-looking soldiers. They had completed a six-week westward trek from the Sierra Maestra, withstanding cyclones and enemy fire and sleeping in swamps. Guevara described his men as “morally broken, starving . . . their feet bloodied and so swollen they won’t fit into what’s left of their boots.” Guevara—whom another rebel once depicted as “half athletic and half asthmatic,” and prone to shifting in conversation “between Stalin and Baudelaire”—had dark hair nearly to his shoulders. During the march, he had worn the cap of a dead comrade, but, to his distress, he had lost it, and so he began wearing a black beret.

The ranks of the Second Front had grown to more than a thousand men. Morgan wrote to his mother, “We are much stronger now,” and said that his men were “getting ready to come down from the hills and take the cities.”

Guevara had been sent to the Escambray to take control of the Second Front, as Castro was eager to eliminate any threat to his dominance and to accelerate the assault on Batista. But many rebels there resisted having their authority usurped, and submerged tensions between the groups rose to the surface. When Guevara and his men tried to enter a stretch of territory, they were confronted by a particularly combative leader of the Second Front, Jesús Carreras. After demanding a password from Guevara, Carreras refused to let him or his men pass. 

Morgan and Guevara, the two foreign comandantes, bitterly distrusted each other. The boisterous, fun-loving, anti-Communist American had little in common with the ascetic, erudite, Marxist-Leninist Argentine doctor. Morgan complained to Guevara that he had misappropriated weapons belonging to the Second Front, while Guevara dismissed Morgan and his defiant guerrillas as comevacas—“cow-eaters”—meaning that they sat around and lived off the largesse of peasants. Although Guevara and the Second Front reached an “operational pact,” friction remained. 

In November, 1958, before a climactic push against Batista’s Army, Morgan slipped away with Rodríguez to a farmhouse in the mountains, where they arranged to get married. They wore their rebel uniforms, which they had washed in the river. They didn’t have rings, so Morgan took a leaf from a tree, rolled it into a circle, and placed it on her finger, vowing, “I will love you and honor you all the days of my life.” Rodríguez said, “Hasta que la muerte nos separe”—“Till death do us part.”

After the ceremony, Morgan picked up his gun and returned to battle. “We barely had time to kiss,” Rodríguez recalls. As the fighting intensified, she had a growing sense of unease. To keep her company, he had given her a parrot that cried “We-liam” and “I love you!” But one day it flew off, and never returned.

In late December, Guevara and his party launched a ferocious assault in the Santa Clara province, winning a decisive victory. That month, Morgan and the Second Front seized the tobacco town of Manicaragua, then pressed onward, capturing Cumanayagua, El Hoyo, La Moza, and San Juan de los Yeras, before reaching Topes de Collantes, a hundred and sixty miles southeast of Havana. One of Batista’s colonels warned, “Headquarters can’t resist anymore. The Army doesn’t want to fight.” The Second Front had earlier issued a statement declaring that “the dictatorship is nearly crushed,” and the U.S. government tried to push out Batista, in a futile attempt to install an acquiescent “third force.” Batista resisted the Americans’ pressure, but his hold on power was nearly gone.

At 4 A.M. on New Year’s Day, David Atlee Phillips, a C.I.A. agent stationed in Havana, was standing outside his home there, drinking champagne, when he looked up and saw a speck of light—an airplane—receding into the sky. Realizing that there were no departing flights at that hour, he telephoned his case officer, and offered a gem of information: “Batista just flew into exile.”

“Are you drunk?” the case officer replied.

But Phillips was right—Batista was escaping, with his entourage, to the Dominican Republic—and word rapidly spread throughout Cuba: “Se fue! Se fue! ” He’s gone! 

Meyer Lansky was in Havana at the time, and was among the first people there to be tipped off. “Get the money,” he commanded an associate. “All of it. Even the cash and checks in reserve.” 

After dawn, Morgan was preparing to battle for the city of Cienfuegos when the cry reached him and Rodríguez: Se fue! Se fue! Morgan ordered his men to take the city immediately. Everyone, including Rodríguez, jumped into cars and trucks, racing into a city where they had expected an intense battle but where Batista’s Army, once impregnable, dissolved before them as thousands of jubilant residents poured into the streets, honking horns and banging on makeshift drums. The crowds greeted Morgan, who wrapped a rebel flag around his shoulders like a cape, to shouts of “Americano!” Morgan, who told reporters, “I’m forgetting my English,” cried at the crowds grasping at him, “Victoria! Libertad!” 

In an interview with Look, Morgan said, “When we came down from the mountains, it was a shock to all of us . . . to find how much faith the Cuban people had in this revolution. You felt you simply couldn’t betray their hopes.” 

Morgan was put in charge of Cienfuegos. He had finally become somebody, he told a friend. On January 6, 1959, at one in the morning, Castro paused in Cienfuegos during his triumphant march to Havana. It was the first time that Morgan had met with Castro in Cuba, and the two former delinquents shook hands and congratulated each other. 

In interviews, Castro repeated his opposition to Communism and promised to hold elections within eighteen months. Before a gathering of thousands in Havana, he vowed, “We cannot become dictators.” Whatever doubts Morgan had about Guevara, he seemed to harbor none about Castro, who once declared, “History will absolve me.”

“I have a tremendous admiration—a tremendous respect—for the man,” Morgan later told the American television broadcaster Clete Roberts. “I respect his moral courage, and I respect his honesty.” Morgan cast the revolution in his own distinctive terms: “It’s about time the little guy got a break.”

Roberts observed that Morgan’s life, including his romance with Rodríguez, sounded “like all of the movie scripts that were ever dreamt about in Hollywood.” Morgan insisted that he had no interest in selling his story: “I don’t believe that you should cash in on your ideals. I don’t believe I was an idealist when I went up into the mountains, but I feel that I’m an idealist now.”

Morgan had not slept for two days after Batista fled, and he welcomed the chance to shave and wash the jungle grime off his body. Rodríguez soon changed out of her uniform, confident that “the war was over and that we would raise a family and live in a democracy.” In Cienfuegos, they exchanged proper wedding rings. Rodríguez says, “I cannot describe the happiness I felt—we felt.”

Rodríguez had become pregnant. For Morgan, it suddenly seemed that he and Rodríguez could have everything: a house, children, the morning paper. As Morgan put it, “All I’m interested in is settling down to a nice, peaceful existence.”

THE CONSPIRACY

In March, 1959, a mysterious American suddenly appeared at the Hotel Capri, where Morgan and Rodríguez were staying temporarily. The man, who was in his late forties, had stiff black hair and thick glasses, and looked like he could be an employee of NASA, the new space agency. In the lobby, he called Morgan and said that he needed to see him. His name was Leo Cherne. “I’m sure he never heard of me before,” Cherne recalled, in an unpublished oral history. 

Imposing, learned, and discreet, Cherne was a wealthy businessman and a power broker who had advised several U.S. Presidents, including Franklin Roosevelt and Eisenhower. In 1951, he became chairman of the International Rescue Committee. Over the years, there was speculation that, under Cherne, the I.R.C. had sometimes served as a front for C.I.A. activities—a charge that Cherne publicly denied. In any case, he was enmeshed with people in intelligence circles, a man who relished being privy to a cloak-and-dagger world.

In his oral history, Cherne said that he had once been “deeply attracted” to Castro, rivalling Herbert Matthews in his “blind enthusiasm.” But Cherne had grown apprehensive after the revolution. With disturbing coolness, Castro had dispatched several hundred members of Batista’s regime “to the wall,” and his indeterminate ideology, his instinctive defiance, and his gargantuan ambition posed serious risks.

And so the C.I.A. sought to put more eyes and ears around Castro, eventually assigning him the cryptonym AMTHUG. Morgan must have seemed like a tantalizing target for recruitment. He had a built-in cover and access, spoke Spanish, and, as a U.S. citizen, seemed easier to turn: he would not have to become a traitor to his country. Morgan’s support for Castro and the revolution presented an impediment, but, as any seasoned case officer knew, virtually everyone had a “soft spot”: greed, jealousy, sexual temptation. One simply needed to find the spot and inflame it, until the target breached a system of beliefs for a system of information, for silent calls and dead drops. 

It seemed that Morgan had a spark of resentment that could catch fire. Castro, wary of rivals, had denied prominent government positions to many members of the Second National Front of the Escambray, including Menoyo. Adam Clayton Powell, a congressman from New York, had just returned from a fact-finding mission in Cuba, where he had overheard Morgan—whom he described as “a sweet guy, but very tough”—criticizing the new regime.

At the Hotel Capri, Cherne was surprised to find that Morgan occupied a small, sparely furnished room. Rodríguez had gone out, but armed barbudos—bearded guerrillas—kept entering and exiting, as if the cramped room were a makeshift headquarters. Morgan wore his rebel uniform, the star of a comandante emblazoned on each epaulet. His revolver rested on a dresser.

Cherne told Morgan that he had sought him out to promote the I.R.C.’s work in Cuba and to obtain an audience with Castro, but Morgan was wary. He knew that Havana had become a city of spooks, and Cherne had shown him an I.R.C. brochure featuring William Joseph (Wild Bill) Donovan—the famous spymaster of the Second World War, who was an honorary chairman of the committee’s board. Morgan suspected that Cherne was an American intelligence officer representing “very substantial and powerful forces.”

As they conferred, Morgan, perhaps believing that his secrets would be safe with a professional keeper of them, confessed something that he had not revealed even to his closest friends, including Menoyo. Morgan admitted that the story he had told about an American friend being killed by Batista was a fabrication—a sleight of hand that had allowed him to sneak himself into the narrative of history. “Morgan told the truth, trusting that I would not take it public,” Cherne recalled. Morgan touched on his troubled past, and Cherne believed that Morgan was “courageous, tough, able, resourceful but a bad boy. . . . And it was this bad boy who found in the developing events in Cuba something exciting.” 

Cherne observed how well Morgan spoke Spanish, how he commanded respect from the rebels passing through the room, and how bright he seemed, despite having only an eighth-grade education. “I’ve rarely met a person as genuinely articulate, as clever, in some ways brilliant, as I found him to be, all by instinct,” Cherne noted.

He soon returned to the Capri for another meeting. This time, a barbudo lay sprawled on the bed, apparently dozing. Morgan, even then the loose-lipped Gabby, said that he wanted to disclose something “very important.” 

Cherne looked around anxiously, and asked, “How do you know the room is secure?” 

Morgan assured him that it was, but Cherne pointed to an air-conditioning vent, where a bug might be installed. “I must apologize,” Morgan said. “You are absolutely right.” He picked up a transistor radio, placed it in front of the vent, and cranked up the music. 

Cherne was still concerned about the Cuban on the bed. Morgan’s “blithe willingness to take risks was not altogether to my taste,” Cherne recalled. But, sensing that Morgan had “irresistible” information, he let him proceed and, with his permission, even used a miniature recording device that he had brought with him. Morgan confided that Guevara and Raúl Castro were Marxist-Leninists who threatened the revolution. Guevara had enlisted someone to kill him, but Morgan had captured the agent and, before letting him go, obtained a written confession, which he had stashed away. “That is the insurance policy which will keep me alive,” Morgan claimed.

Cherne asked Morgan if he thought that Fidel Castro was a Communist. Morgan said no and emphasized that many Cubans were committed to democracy. Cherne found Morgan’s tale of intrigue “filled with perceptive fact.” 

Morgan expressed the hope that Cherne could use his influence to secure foreign economic aid for some three thousand families in the Escambray who had been “bombed out” during the war. And he said he was worried that the U.S. government would revoke his citizenship, as some anti-Castro elements were clamoring for. Cherne suspected that he had pinpointed Morgan’s soft spot: the Yankee comandante wanted to make sure that, if things grew too dangerous, he could return to America with his family; he feared being left out in the cold. 

Cherne believed that Morgan was not seeking personal advantage. Rather, Morgan was hoping to “even the score” with his beloved country, where he had fallen short as a citizen and a soldier. “This was his act of expiation,” Cherne concluded.

Morgan handed Cherne a 1946 five-centavo coin. Its edge had a small notch. If Cherne wanted to send someone to see him in the future, he should give that person the coin for presentation to Morgan—a sign of trustworthiness.

After Cherne left the hotel, with the coin and the recording of their conversation tucked away, he grew anxious that he had been spied upon. Why had he taken such a foolish risk? Cherne scribbled on paper what he had learned, put it in an envelope, and slipped it to a trusted friend in Havana. “Just in case I didn’t get out,” he recalled.

Cherne returned to his hotel and remained in his room. The phone rang, but he did not answer it. “I heard footsteps outside my door, and I sweated freely,” he recalled. Finally, he rushed to the airport, waited an “interminable period,” and “wasn’t relieved until the plane took off.”

On March 20th, Cherne went to C.I.A. headquarters—then a complex of shabby buildings on E Street, in Northwest Washington, D.C. A sign saying “U.S. Government Printing Office” had once hung out front, but, after President Eisenhower and his driver struggled to find the entrance, it was replaced with the C.I.A.’s emblem. 

Cherne was ushered through security and into the French Room, a conference space used by senior C.I.A. officials, where he met with the acting chief of the Western Hemisphere Division. Cherne debriefed him about his encounter with Morgan, which he considered one of the “most incredible and fascinating accidental exposures to political reality in my entire life.” The C.I.A. cultivates its own private language, and Cherne, who was identified in a classified document about Morgan simply as “HQS contact,” was serving as a spotter—someone who identifies a potential asset for recruitment. Cherne told the C.I.A. that Morgan could be very valuable, as he was on excellent terms with Castro. And Cherne passed on Morgan’s coin—the kind of object that the magician Mulholland called a “recognition signal.” 

A C.I.A. report concluded that Morgan had “KUCAGE possibilities.” In his 1975 book, “Inside the Company,” Philip Agee, a former C.I.A. officer who turned against the agency and allegedly assisted Castro’s regime, revealed that KUCAGE stood for highly sensitive psychological and paramilitary operations. “They are action rather than collection activities,” Agee wrote. “Collection operations should be invisible so that the target will be unaware of them. Action operations, on the other hand, always produce a visible effect. This, however, should never be attributable to the C.I.A. or to the U.S. government.”

Not long after Castro took power, the C.I.A. began to seek out action operators who could press the “magic button”: assassination. In addition to commissioning Mulholland’s manuals, the C.I.A. had created a document titled “A Study of Assassination.” After noting that the “morally squeamish should not attempt it,” the study laid out various techniques:



The most efficient accident . . . is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface. Elevator shafts, stair wells, unscreened windows and bridges will serve. . . . The act may be executed by sudden, vigorous [lifting] of the ankles, tipping the subject over the edge. If the subject is deliberately run down, very exact timing is necessary and investigation is likely to be thorough. . . . The subject may be stunned or drugged and then placed in the car, but this is only reliable when the car can be run off a high cliff or into deep water without observation.




At the end of March, the C.I.A. authorized a background investigation of Morgan—“a.k.a. ‘El Americano.’ ” Its agents needed more “biographical data” before trying to recruit Morgan. On March 30th, the agency’s Central Cover Division requested that it be advised immediately when Morgan had been “activated.”

Two weeks later, Castro arrived in Washington, D.C., on what he billed as a “good will” tour. President Eisenhower declined to meet with him, but, when Castro appeared in public, wearing his rumpled green fatigues and empty pistol holster, he was cheered by Americans who saw him as a folk hero. “Viva Castro!” they shouted.

Around this time, as Aran Shetterly, the biographer, recounts, another curious guest appeared at the Hotel Capri. He was a reputed bagman for the Mob named Frank Nelson. The Mob feared, correctly, that Castro planned to shutter its casinos and night clubs. (“We are not only disposed to deport the gangsters, but to shoot them,” Castro later proclaimed.)

Nelson said that a friend in Miami was interested in Morgan’s “services.”

“In my services?” Morgan asked, confused.

It was Nelson’s turn to look around the room nervously. In a hushed voice, he said, “My friend is ready to pay you well if you help him.” He paused. “A million dollars.”

The conversation continued in Miami, where Morgan met in a secure hotel room with Nelson’s “friend.” It was the Dominican Republic’s consul there, who was serving as yet another go-between, in order to conceal the true identity of the plotters. One of the masterminds was Rafael Trujillo, the tyrant who had ruled the Dominican Republic for three decades, and who was even more sadistic than Batista. His security chief likened his rule to that of “Caligula, the mad Caesar.” 

One of Trujillo’s maxims was “He who does not know how to deceive does not know how to rule,” and he had a penchant for scheming to kill his opponents abroad. In 1956, Trujillo allegedly orchestrated the kidnapping, in New York, of a lecturer at Columbia University who had served in the Trujillo government, and was about to publish a doctoral thesis critical of the regime. After being taken back to the Dominican Republic and delivered to Trujillo, the scholar was believed to have been stripped naked, tied to a rope on a pulley, then lowered, slowly, into a vat of boiling water. Now Trujillo wanted to eliminate Fidel Castro. 

In the hotel room in Miami, Trujillo’s consul was joined by Batista’s former chief of police. (Batista, still in the Dominican Republic, was helping to bankroll the operation.) Also present was a broad-chested, dapper man whom Morgan recognized from his days in organized crime: Dominick Bartone. After the revolution, the gangster had sought out Morgan, trying to sell the Castro regime several Globemaster military cargo airplanes. Bartone was now trying to sell the planes to the plotters seeking to overthrow Castro. Bartone’s ally Jimmy Hoffa had allegedly attempted to siphon three hundred thousand dollars from the Teamsters’ pension fund to float the deal. One of Hoffa’s aides later informed the government that the scheme “was purely and simply Hoffa’s way of helping some of his Mob buddies who were afraid of losing their businesses in Cuba.” 

The men in the hotel room represented interests tied to the Mob, the Teamsters, Batista, and Trujillo, a longtime ally of the United States. These divergent lethal forces had found coherence in a single audacious plot. 

As they tried to persuade Morgan, they, too, probed for his soft spot. “I understand that you and your people have been treated badly,” Nelson had said in his pitch. “Besides, a million dollars is always a million dollars.” 

To the rest of the world, Morgan might have become the Yankee comandante. But the plotters were confident that, deep down, he was still good ol’ Billy Morgan. 

“We’ll give you everything you ask for,” Batista’s former police chief said.

Morgan soon got back to them. He let them know that he had consulted with Menoyo, and that they had given careful thought to what had happened in Cuba since the revolution. And Morgan said that he, along with members of the Second Front, was ready to join the conspiracy.

Hoover sensed that something was afoot. There were reports from informants that, in recent months, Morgan had received tens of thousands of dollars from the Dominican consul, the cash often stuffed in “common paper bags.” There were whispers that Morgan, who had moved with Rodríguez into a house in Havana, was being ferried messages from a priest acting in the interest not of God but of Rafael Trujillo. And there were rumors that, in Florida, Morgan had met with Johnny Abbes García, the head of Trujillo’s secret police, who was a master at extracting information (he had studied Chinese methods of torture) and at concealing it (he reputedly had an affair with Trujillo’s half brother). “JOHNNY went to Miami to make contact with MORGAN,” an F.B.I. report said, adding that Abbes García and his bodyguard had “a good time in a calypso nightclub.”

Hoover and his men tried to detect a hidden design in the data they were collecting. They were witnessing history without the clarity of hindsight or narrative, and it was like peering through a windshield lashed with rain. As Hoover confronted the gaps in his knowledge, he became more and more obsessed with Morgan. A former fire-eater at the circus! Hoover hounded his evidence men to “expedite” their inquiries, homing in on Morgan’s ties to Dominick Bartone. The mobster, whom the bureau classified as “armed and dangerous,” had recently been arrested with his associates at Miami International Airport, where they had been caught loading a plane with thousands of pounds of weapons—a shipment apparently destined for mercenaries and Cuban exiles being trained in the Dominican Republic. 

The incident had not only intensified Hoover’s scrutiny of Morgan and the plotters; it also aroused the interest of the Senate Rackets Committee and its chief counsel, Robert F. Kennedy, who was investigating links between Hoffa’s Teamsters and organized crime. At a hearing in June, 1959, Kennedy demanded, “Do we have any background on Mr. Morgan?” When a Teamster official was questioned by the committee about the weapons scheme, he said, more than once, “I decline to answer because I honestly believe my answer may tend to incriminate me.” Another witness, however, acknowledged that Morgan had “worked for Bartone in years past.”

While the F.B.I. tracked Morgan’s movements, he made repeated forays to Miami, where he met with his conspirators. That summer, he also travelled to Toledo for a visit with his mother and father, whom he had not seen since leaving for Cuba, a year and a half earlier. His parents savored the brief reunion, but they could tell that Morgan was feeling “heat and pressure,” as he later put it. When his mother looked at his clothing and belongings, she noticed that there wasn’t any identification on him—he’d become a man from nowhere.

She asked him what kind of trouble he was getting into now.

Nothing, he assured her.

But she sensed that he was planning to pull off, as she later put it, yet another “trick.”

The hand is not “quicker than the eye,” Mulholland warned in his spy manuals. The key to an illusion is to make the audience explain away the fact that it has been deceived in plain sight. 

On July 27, 1959, Morgan flew again to Miami, this time with Rodríguez. Eight months pregnant, she provided some cover. Still, Morgan was stopped by authorities at the airport in Miami and taken to a holding room, where he was confronted by two men with close-cropped hair, dark suits, and dark ties: Hoover’s agents. 

After apprising Morgan of his rights, the agents pressed him about why he had come to Miami. He insisted that he was there to have fun with his wife for a few days, but, under further questioning, he admitted that a representative of a foreign government had contacted him about leading a counter-revolution in Cuba. “Subject refused to identify the individuals with whom he was in contact,” the agents wrote in a report. 

Morgan said that he was in a “precarious position.” The agents eventually let him go, but Hoover ordered his men to monitor Morgan’s movements by “employing physical surveillances and utilizing other confidential techniques.” The F.B.I. reported that “subject’s pregnant wife was seen being driven from the Montmartre Hotel in a 1959 blue Cadillac.” The agents traced the car: it belonged to Dominick Bartone. 

On July 31st, Morgan phoned the F.B.I., letting its agents know that Rodríguez had returned to Cuba. He said that he planned to go back himself, on a Pan American flight, in two days. Within hours of the call, though, he took off, leaving his belongings in his hotel room. The agents tried to pick up his trail, but he had vanished. 

On the night of August 6th, the F.B.I. subsequently learned, Morgan boarded a small fishing vessel, in a “clandestine manner,” and rendezvoused off the coast of Miami with a fifty-four-foot yacht manned by two mercenaries. The vessel was stripped of any name or registration number, and was loaded with machine guns, explosives, and other armaments. With Morgan aboard, the yacht set off for Cuba and, after eluding the U.S. Coast Guard and nearly running out of fuel, slipped into Havana Harbor, on August 8th. 

Hoover believed that he was worming his way inside the conspiracy. One F.B.I. source reported that Morgan was planning to “assassinate Castro.” Another said that the plot was to take out Fidel and Raúl Castro. According to multiple sources, a strike force of nearly a thousand Cuban exiles and mercenaries would be transported, by plane, from a base in the Dominican Republic to Trinidad, a colonial town at the foot of the Escambray Mountains. Once these forces landed, it was believed, they would be led by Morgan, whom a cable from the U.S. Embassy described as “an enigma.” 

Morgan had received from Trujillo a shortwave radio—a bulky contraption with dozens of thick black dials. Morgan set it up on a wooden desk in his house, and after turning the dials he heard the scratchy sound of a voice: Trujillo’s killer spy, Abbes García, in the Dominican Republic. 

An informant later told the F.B.I. that Abbes García operated his radio every evening after midnight, and often identified himself by saying, “This is the Red Cow.” 

Morgan was given the code name Henry—a reference to Henry Morgan, the seventeenth-century Welsh privateer, who had been commissioned by the English crown to plunder gold from Cuba, then a Spanish colony. Once, when Henry Morgan found himself trapped by a Spanish armada, he floated toward the enemy a ship, rigged with incendiary materials and wooden dummies, which then exploded, allowing him to escape, in one of the greatest ruses in seafaring history.

William Morgan flicked on the shortwave radio late one August night. “Henry speaking,” he said. “Come in . . . Come in . . . ”

The Red Cow picked up his signal, and Morgan told him that the plot had begun. “Our troops are advancing,” he said.

Abbes García could hear bombs and gunfire in the background.

“Forward, Henry!” came the jubilant reply. 

Hoover and other high-level officials at the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, and the State Department circulated intelligence about Morgan and his plot. Urgent wire reports were issued: “Fidel’s home in Cojimar shot . . . Reliable sources state small group attacked Raúl’s home . . . Whereabouts Morgan not known . . . Telephone communications to Las Villas and Camagüey provinces cut . . . Rumors of fighting . . . Armed services on full alert . . . Expecting something further, probably invasion . . . Havana Harbor will be bombed at 4:00 a.m. . . . It is expected that Castro will be finished.”

Hoover and his colleagues picked up intelligence that Morgan and other members of the Second Front, including Menoyo and Jesús Carreras, had gathered in Trinidad, where they had secured a muddy airstrip, effectively cutting the island in two. Trujillo was heard broadcasting a message to the Cuban people, saying, “Fire, fire, fire to that demon Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl!” Trujillo began to air-drop dozens of crates of .50-calibre ammunition to Morgan and his followers, the billowing white parachutes seesawing down from the clouds. When another supply plane returned, its crew reported seeing lit bombs tracing paths across the night sky, as if there were an electrical storm. On August 12th, Morgan, who had brought the shortwave radio with him, spoke to Trujillo, and told him that his forces had captured the town. “Trinidad is ours!” Morgan said. “Don’t let us down.” 

The following evening—Castro’s thirty-third birthday—Trujillo dispatched to Cuba a plane carrying the first members of the strike force. As the soldiers disembarked at the airstrip in Trinidad, which had been marked with lights, they could hear Morgan and his men shouting denunciations of Castro, and, as they joined in, the cries grew louder and more intense, converging, like voices at a stadium, in a deafening incantation: “DEATH TO CASTRO!” 

Then a towering, bearded figure, who had also been chanting, emerged from where he was hiding, under a mango tree. It was Fidel Castro. 

Morgan had pulled off a trick within a trick. He was not a counter-revolutionary—he was a double agent. He and the Second Front had been colluding with Castro; the radio messages, the cutting of communications, and the exploding bombs had all been part of the stagecraft of what Morgan described as a “fictitious war.”

Morgan and those loyal to Castro pointed machine guns at the stunned fighters from the strike force. One of Trujillo’s men later said, “I should not be judged as a conspirator, but as an imbecile.” Soldiers from the strike force drew their guns, and for a moment the plotters and the counter-plotters peered at one another, as if still puzzling over who had crossed whom. Then a few of Trujillo’s men opened fire, and everyone began shooting. One of Morgan’s friends ran toward the plane and was killed. By the time the fusillade ended, two members of the strike force had died, and the rest had been apprehended.

Morgan had helped break the first major counter-revolutionary plot against the Castro regime. Later, during a five-hour televised address that lasted until three in the morning, Castro explained what had happened. Morgan, smiling and wearing his crisp rebel uniform, appeared beside him. During the previous few months, he and Castro had spent hours scheming. Castro was seen draping his long arm around Morgan, his prized double agent. He hailed Morgan as a “Cuban,” and Morgan referred to Castro as his “faithful friend.” Menoyo recalls, “They had complete trust in one another.” 

The Yankee comandante revealed to the public that, after being approached to lead the counter-revolution, he and Menoyo had alerted Castro, who directed them to draw out their enemies. Castro said in his televised address, “Everyone played his assigned parts. It was better than a movie.” Herbert Matthews, in a letter to Hemingway, described the events as “stranger than fiction but real.” 

Morgan and Menoyo had been so convincing in their roles as counter-revolutionaries that Leo Cherne, and others, suspected that they had originally been part of the conspiracy, switching sides only when they were about to be discovered. But, according to Menoyo and others involved in the scheme, they had not turned against Castro—who remained revered in Cuba, and who had reaffirmed his support of democratic principles during his April visit to Washington. Despite Morgan’s concerns about the Castro regime, he stated emphatically that he and members of the Second Front would “never unite” with brutes like Trujillo or Batista. 

On August 20th, Morgan called the F.B.I. agents who had pursued him in Miami, and apologized for not having been more forthcoming. He explained that he had not wanted to “sell out Cuba,” where he had many friends. He added that he didn’t think that he had broken any American laws, though he might have “bent” them slightly.

The Secret Service launched an investigation of Morgan and recommended that no action be taken against this man of “unquestioned courage,” given that he posed no threat to “the safety and welfare of our President.” But Hoover fumed over the deception, and in September the State Department stripped Morgan of his citizenship.

The C.I.A. made no effort to intercede on Morgan’s behalf. That May, according to declassified documents, the agency had cancelled its effort to recruit him, after a background check turned up evidence of his criminal youth and his scandalous military record. An internal memorandum had noted, “Station strongly feels any covert arrangement with Morgan undesirable from security standpoint.” In the end, the authentic nature of Morgan’s rebelliousness made him too unpredictable: better to deal with someone simply looking for a score. 

Trujillo—who was later assassinated in a C.I.A.-assisted plot—placed a half-million-dollar bounty on Morgan’s head. When Clete Roberts, the American broadcaster, visited Morgan’s house, in September, 1959, he found it surrounded by bodyguards with Thompson submachine guns. “I ought to tell you back in the United States that Mr. Morgan and I are sitting in what you might call an armed camp,” Roberts said. He asked Morgan, “How does it feel to have a half-million-dollar price on your head?”

Morgan replied coolly, “Well, it isn’t too bad. They are going to have to collect it. And that’s going to be hard.”

The Castro government made Morgan a Cuban “citizen by birth” and promised to protect him. The Associated Press wrote that he had obtained “almost legendary stature” on the island, and Cherne said that he had become “the hero of the republic.” Morgan further bolstered his reputation when he handed over to the Cuban government seventy-eight thousand dollars that he had received from the Dominican consul, asking that the money be invested in economic development in the Escambray region. When Morgan walked along the streets of Havana, people reached out to touch him; there was even a popular song celebrating his exploits.

In August, Rodríguez gave birth to a daughter, who was named for Morgan’s mother, Loretta. Rodríguez recalls that Castro showed up at the clinic to congratulate her and Morgan. “He wanted to be the godfather,” Rodríguez says, though the honor went to Menoyo. 

Morgan was astonished that so many Cubans had embraced him. “These are people who never saw me before in their lives,” he told Roberts. “They never knew me. They just know me by what I’ve done or how I’ve been with them.”

He said that the revolution had been fought for a beautiful idea—freedom—and that he was not willing to abandon the promises that he had made in the mountains. Though a few Marxist-Leninists had tried to “sneak” into power amid the turmoil in the country, he said, the Cuban people were too individualistic to accept such a system. “Communism breeds on ignorance and poverty,” he said. “And the first thing that the revolution is doing is creating schools and creating jobs and creating homes and giving people land in which they can increase their income.” He acknowledged that many of Cuba’s revolutionaries were young and inexperienced, and had made mistakes; but their main political aim remained helping “the little guy.” 

Though Morgan was anguished over losing his American citizenship—“The greatest thing that ever happened to me was to have been born in the United States,” he once said—he was content with his growing family, and was eager to help build a new Cuban society. “I’m a Cuban now,” he said. “And I believe in the revolution.” Or, as he later put it, “I am betting my life that the revolution succeeds.”

THEY’RE GONNA GET YOU!

Morgan did not take a post in the Castro government, saying, “I’ve never been a politician—I’m a soldier.” But he remained an adventurer, and in the fall of 1959 he set up a bold experiment in Cuba’s swamps, under the auspices of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform. Earning a small monthly salary, he built several nurseries, including one in the Escambray, that bred bullfrogs for their tender meat and valuable skins, which could be used to make wallets and belts and purses.

Morgan began with a few frogs, but they quickly multiplied, the tadpoles becoming stout creatures that, with their legs extended, were as long as a foot. The nurseries were soon filled with a mass of croaking creatures devouring, whole, virtually anything they could swallow—bugs, fish, mice, even other frogs—the wild proliferation continuing until Morgan presided over a kingdom of more than half a million frogs. It was like the story of Exodus that he had read as a child: “And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.”

Morgan often worked eighteen-hour days, digging a network of shaded trenches to accommodate his ever-growing stock. The Cuban press hailed Morgan’s project as a “miracle,” and when a reporter asked him if he had used architectural diagrams to lay out the farms he replied, “Blueprints, your ass. I dug those fucking ditches.” 

He hired hundreds of peasants to operate the farms, delivering the kind of economic opportunity that he and the rebels had promised during the revolution. Viola June Cobb, an American who had worked as a secretary for Fidel Castro, later testified secretly before a Senate subcommittee, and said that Morgan was “a boy with ideals” who had a “tremendous desire to be helpful,” and that through his farms he had improved the lives of some two thousand peasants. “The ones I had seen in rags and barefoot now were wearing shoes and stockings, looking decent,” she said. 

Dignitaries and reporters travelled to the swamps to see the famed Yankee comandante and double agent. An article in Time called him the “Improbable Frogman.” Morgan projected his usual buoyant self. “Cuban frogs’ legs are tops,” he’d say. Or “Cuba shipped a million dollars’ worth of frogs’ legs to the U.S. last year. I’m going to double that.” 

On July 31, 1960, Rodríguez gave birth to a second girl, Olguita. Before Morgan came to Cuba, he had been a neglectful father, and he regretted it. He had sent a letter to Anne, his daughter from his second marriage, who was now five:



When I saw you last you were just a little tyke. . . . You use to sit in the window and when you saw my car drive in you would say—Daddy Daddy. . . . And I know when I did not come home any more I know you missed me and looked out the window for your dad—this was a long time ago baby and possibly you don’t remember—but I do—And always will.




Morgan now doted on his baby girls, having concluded that a man who has “his family is probably the happiest person in the world.” In a debriefing by the C.I.A., a reporter said of Morgan, “He seemed happy and secure.”

But, after foiling the Trujillo conspiracy and helping to save the revolution, he grew increasingly uneasy with the political forces that he had helped to unleash. Morgan had predicted to the F.B.I. that the influence of radicals, such as Guevara and Raúl Castro, would diminish in Cuba. But Fidel had placed Raúl in charge of the armed forces, and appointed as head of the national bank Guevara, who pushed for increased state control over the economy.

On October 19th, Huber Matos, a heralded rebel commander, resigned from the government, protesting the growing influence of Communists. In a letter to Fidel Castro, he wrote, “Please, in the names of our fallen comrades, of our mothers, of all the people, Fidel, do not bury the revolution.” Two days later, Matos was arrested. He was sentenced to twenty years in prison. 

Earlier that year, in March, the White House had approved a top-secret plan to topple the Castro regime. The operation came to eerily resemble the Trujillo conspiracy. A brigade of more than a thousand Cuban exiles—this time secretly trained by the U.S., at a base in Guatemala—would invade by sea, landing at a beach in the town of Trinidad. B-26 bombers would preëmptively strike Castro’s Air Force to protect the brigade, which, if necessary, could escape into the Escambray Mountains. It was the most ambitious covert operation in U.S. history. At a White House meeting, President Eisenhower told the plan’s architects, “Everyone must be prepared to swear that he has not heard of it.” 

That summer, while preparations for an invasion were under way, the C.I.A. pushed the magic button. In another echo of the Trujillo plot, the agency turned to members of the Mafia, including an associate of Lansky’s, to assassinate Castro. Various stratagems were considered, including blowing Castro’s head off with an exploding cigar, jabbing him with a poison-filled Paper Mate pen, and contaminating a diving suit with tuberculosis germs.

Amid this blur of plots and counter-plots, Morgan struggled to find clarity. No longer close with Castro, he could not tell if the Cuban leader was reacting to provocations from Washington, or if he was being undermined by more radical elements in the government, or if he was revealing that, beneath his rebel garb, he was just another dictator, willing to grasp any ideology that would consolidate his power. 

One day, members of the Communist Party tried to organize a meeting on one of Morgan’s farms. He expelled them, saying, “Fidel and Raúl know that I’m against the Communists.” 

A friend of Morgan’s from the Second Front recalls, “I said to William, ‘You have to be careful. You’re talking too much.’ But William loved to talk.”

In April, 1960, a reporter observed of Morgan, “Behind the bravado one senses confusion, regret, anxiety over what lies ahead.” In Havana, Morgan’s house had been shot at more than once—perhaps by agents of Trujillo or perhaps by an unknown enemy. “One time, they killed our dog,” Rodríguez recalls. Afterward, Morgan moved the family into an apartment building protected by more than a dozen guards, many of whom lived with them. “It always seemed that we could never be alone,” he once said to Rodríguez.

An informant told the C.I.A. that Morgan’s “every move was being watched by the Cuban military.” Rodríguez suspected that two of the bodyguards living with them were spying for the G-2, Castro’s military-intelligence service. “I wanted them out,” she recalls. But Morgan did not wish to be disloyal. In this sense, Morgan was not a classic double agent, for he was someone who wanted to believe. “He always trusted people,” Rodríguez says. Still, he took precautions, choosing his own driver, and going to work in a blue Oldsmobile outfitted with two submachine guns and a glove compartment stuffed with grenades. 

Morgan had no desire to flee Cuba. As he later told his mother, “It would have been necessary to be a traitor to myself, my friends and my beliefs.” He continued tending to his frogs, with their deafening chorus.

One day, Morgan learned that his rebel comrade Jesús Carreras, now an antagonist of the regime, had been picked up by state security, in Santa Clara. Morgan raced to the military barracks there, and demanded that the guards release Carreras. “I’m a comandante!” Morgan shouted, pointing to his star. The guards complied, and Morgan escorted Carreras away, mindful of the warning that another rebel colleague had given him: “Watch out! They’re gonna get you!”

Morgan considered seeking political asylum for his family. But he had confessed to one reporter, “I’ve run out of countries,” and noted to another that “a guy in the middle can so easily get caught.”

Cuba’s drift toward Communism continued, and several of Morgan’s friends returned to the Escambray, to take up arms against the regime. As Michael D. Sallah reported a decade ago, in an illuminating account in the Toledo Blade, Morgan started to have weapons smuggled into the mountains in the fall of 1960. “Every week, trucks would carry them up,” a worker told me. Once, Morgan was planning to take a shipment to a hideout himself, but Rodríguez said that it was too dangerous. Everyone will recognize you, she said, insisting on transporting the weapons herself. “We had an argument,” she recalls. Rodríguez prevailed, and this time it was Morgan who anxiously waited at home.

His opposition to the regime became more vocal. “If anything happens to me, you’ll know the Commies have really taken over,” he told one reporter, and said to another, “I don’t know how long I’m going to last.”

Still, Viola Cobb, the secretary, says that Morgan did not completely lose faith with Castro: “He had the idea that he was standing by, and that when Fidel finally realized that the Communists were taking over he would blow the whistle, and William Morgan and Gutierrez Menoyo and some of the others would help him rescue the country.”

On October 19th, two days after the Eisenhower Administration recalled Philip Bonsal, its Ambassador to Cuba, presaging the end of diplomatic ties, Morgan was summoned to a meeting at the National Institute for Agrarian Reform. He brought a handbag made from frog skin—a gift for the wife of one of the officials. 

Rodríguez and Morgan had plans that evening, but by seven o’clock he had not returned home. “He was always punctual,” Rodríguez recalls. Her premonitions coming back in a rush, she left the children with their nanny and told Morgan’s driver to take her to the institute. 

At the institute’s gate, she shouted at a guard, “Where’s William?” 

“William had to go someplace,” he said. 

“I need to see William. I have to see him.”

“William said you should come with us.”

The guards began encircling the car, and she told the driver, “Go! Go!” 

They sped away, returning home, but state-security guards soon barged through the apartment door. “I’m the wife of Comandante Morgan,” she said, trying to intimidate them. But they shoved her aside and searched the apartment, terrifying the girls, one of whom was two months old, the other fourteen months. 

Rodríguez learned what had happened to Morgan: upon entering the institute, he had been surrounded by state security and taken to G-2 headquarters. Jesús Carreras had been rounded up, too. Rodríguez had been right about the two bodyguards at the apartment: they were spies.

Rodríguez could not get permission to see Morgan, who had been placed in detention. According to an account that Morgan wrote in prison, which was later smuggled out of the country and obtained by the C.I.A., Cuban military-intelligence officials interrogated him. “I said I would only talk to Fidel,” Morgan wrote. For nearly a month, he was in solitary confinement. He became violently ill and, fearing that the government was trying to poison him, made himself vomit to purge any toxins. 

After a month, he was moved to La Cabaña, the prison overlooking Havana Harbor. Several times, he discovered ground glass in his food. He still felt extremely sick, and asked another prisoner if he had any medicine to “kill pain.” When the man said yes, Morgan pleaded, “Shoot it into my arm.” He didn’t trust the guards to do it. The man obtained a syringe from a prison doctor and injected Morgan with the medicine.

In December, Menoyo, who says that he had not participated in the smuggling of weapons into the Escambray, visited Morgan at La Cabaña. “You are my chief and my brother,” Morgan told him. Menoyo, who had lost both of his siblings to war, replied, “You are my brother.” They embraced.

Not long after Menoyo left the prison, he and a dozen members of the Second Front fled the country, on three small fishing vessels, and headed for America.

On December 31st, Rodríguez, who had been placed under house arrest, was permitted to see her husband. Rats scurried in the corners of the crowded meeting room. Though she did not want to upset Morgan, she told him that she was being held prisoner in their home, and that she had little water or food. “No one is allowed to visit,” she said. “The babies are sick.”

Morgan urged her to flee—to get the children out of Cuba before it was too late. “If you can, go to Toledo,” he said. “My mother will help you.” 

He took her hand. “Everything’s going to be O.K.,” he said. But Rodríguez, who rarely betrayed fear, was scared. “I was so worried about him and what would happen to our baby girls,” she recalls. After five minutes, the guards said that her time was up. 

“I love you with every part of me,” he said. They stole a kiss before being separated.

That night, when Rodríguez returned home, she crushed sleeping pills into hot chocolate and offered the drink to the men guarding her. At two in the morning, when all the guards appeared to be asleep, she gathered her daughters. “Hush,” she whispered to them. When the baby began to cry, she gave her a toy, and then, carrying both girls in her arms, she crept out of the house. She went to the Brazilian Embassy, where she was given sanctuary after telling the Ambassador and his wife, “Please, I’m in big trouble.” 

Morgan was also trying to break free. He studied the design of La Cabaña and the routine of the guards, looking for a flaw in the system. “Morgan had all kinds of escape plots,” another prisoner later told the C.I.A. Morgan worked to regain his strength. A press attaché at the U.S. Embassy later wrote, “Up at dawn, he would put himself through calisthenics, then march around the compound, shouting commands at himself.” The inmate who had given Morgan painkillers recalled, “He exercised like an athlete and marched like a soldier.” Morgan turned increasingly toward his Catholic faith. He wore a rosary and often prayed. 

Hiram González, a twenty-four-year-old revolutionary who had been arrested for conspiring against the regime, had just arrived at La Cabaña, and watched in despair as prisoners were taken out and killed by firing squads, while birds swooped down to “peck at the bits of bone, blood, and flesh.” Morgan, he recalls, tried to cheer him up, offering his mattress. When Morgan found him crying in a corner, he went up to him and said, “Chico, men don’t cry.”

“At times like this, I’m not a man.”

Morgan put his hand on his shoulder. “If it helps your suffering, then it’s O.K.” Morgan walked him around the prison yard until he felt better. “He was the only one to help,” González recalls.

Two days later, on March 9, 1961, guards seized Morgan and escorted him across the compound to a room where a military tribunal was being held. Along the way, Morgan, trying to summon courage, murmured song lyrics to himself: “Over hill, over dale, we have hit the dusty trail / And those caissons go rolling along.”

There were eleven other defendants at the tribunal, including Carreras. Rodríguez was tried in absentia. A few weeks earlier, Che Guevara had published an essay denouncing members of the Second Front. “Revolutions, accelerated radical social changes, are made of circumstances,” he wrote. “They are made of passions, of man’s fight for social vindication, and are never perfect.” The mistake of the Cuban Revolution, Guevara argued, was its accommodation of men like the Second Front commanders. “By their presence, they showed us our sin—the sin of compromise . . . in the face of the actual or potential traitor, in the face of those weak in spirit, in the face of the coward.” He went on, “Revolutionary conduct is the mirror of revolutionary faith, and when someone calls himself a revolutionary and does not act as one, he can be nothing more than heretical. Let them hang together.”

At the trial, Morgan and Carreras were charged with conspiracy and treason. Later, Fabián Escalante, who served for many years as the head of Cuban counter-intelligence, detailed the case against Morgan, claiming that he had been a longtime American intelligence operative—a “chameleon”—who, in 1960, had attempted to “organize, for the C.I.A., a band of counter-revolutionaries in the Escambray.” 

Without a doubt, the C.I.A. was trying to foment the new insurgency in the mountains. But U.S. documents, which have since been declassified, suggest that Morgan was never a C.I.A. operative. Indeed, an agency memorandum dated October 5, 1960—two weeks before Morgan’s arrest—voiced “strenuous objections” to the idea of using him. This followed an inquiry by Army intelligence, which had concluded that enlisting Morgan would be “extremely worthwhile.” (The Army had considered sending him a “secret writing system”—most likely, one involving invisible ink.) After Morgan’s arrest, an Army internal memo noted that Morgan had not become a registered operative. 

“William was never an American agent,” Menoyo says. “It is simply a lie by the Castro regime to justify its actions.”

At the tribunal, Morgan complained that his lawyer had only just learned of the charges against him. Morgan and Carreras, branded pseudo-revolutionaries, faced death by firing squad.

The prisoner who had given Morgan the painkillers recalled, “The whole prison was agog with the news that Morgan and Carreras were actually going to stand trial. Not even the most zealous of the young rebels believed that Fidel Castro would shoot these two men, who had played such a big role in the Cuban Revolution.” 

Morgan denied that he had ever been a foreign agent and said, “I have defended this revolution because I believed in it.” He explained, “If I am found guilty, I will walk to the execution wall with no escort, with moral strength, and with a clear conscience.”

A young man in the back of the courtroom, ignoring warnings by authorities, spoke out on Morgan’s behalf. It was the rebel who had broken his foot in the Escambray. “William would not abandon me,” he recalls.

The trial lasted little more than a day. A defendant’s fate was usually signalled by which room he was taken to before the verdict. “If you went to the right, you went into a copiea, a little chapel-like room, and you knew you were going to get shot,” a prisoner recalled. “For most prisoners, if you went to the left, you got thirty years.”

Most of the defendants were led to the left. Rodríguez, who was twenty-four, also received a thirty-year sentence. Morgan, along with Carreras, was led to the right, and condemned to die the next day. An American radio broadcaster at the trial told his listeners that he had witnessed “a farce.” 

Morgan asked to speak one last time to his mother, but the request was denied. Morgan had written Loretta a five-page letter on La Cabaña stationery—“the longest letter I have ever written,” he told her. (The letter was recently uncovered, by Michael Sallah.) Morgan understood that the very cause that had helped save his life would likely lead to his death. “I have been prepared for this as long as I have been in prison,” he wrote. “For after all it is not when a man dies but how.” 

Morgan knew that he had to get the letter past government censors, so his criticisms of Castro were oblique. “No man has a right to impose his will or beliefs on others,” Morgan wrote. “I feel sorry for those who accuse me and who are responsible for what will pass. They accuse with fear in their hearts and ambition in their minds not knowing that good never comes of evil.” Morgan was ready to give his life for Cuba: “The way of freedom is hard—and the road is covered with the blood of those who must die so that the rights of man can live.” He wanted to protect what he considered sacred about the revolution, and believed that only in time would a proper verdict be rendered on his life: “Humans leave their actions to be judged by other people in the pages of history so it is not what we do but the result of what we do that is finally judged.”

Morgan went on, “I write these things as they run through my mind so that by reading this you might better know what kind of man is your son. . . . Raising a boy like me was not an easy task or did we always agree what was the right thing to do. But I have always worshipped you and dad.” He told his mother, “Don’t cry for me. I know that you understand. The life of a man is in the hands of god and he calls when he is ready for us. It is very few who are fortunate enough to have time to prepare to meet him. If now is my time I will be ready and am looking at death not with fear but with expectation. God bless you. . . . Until we meet again, take care of Olga and the children.”

Loretta could not so easily accept his fate, and launched a furious campaign to save him. She enlisted the local office of the F.B.I. and contacted the White House, which responded, “We fully understand and deeply sympathize with your anxiety for your son.”

After Cuban officials denied Morgan’s request to talk to his mother, he asked if he could say goodbye to Rodríguez. Again, he was refused. So Morgan sent her a letter, knowing that the only thing that could ever separate them was upon them. “As a writer of love letters I am not so good,” he said. “To tell you that I love you, it’s not sufficient, because words could never express my feelings towards you. Since the first time I saw you in the mountains until the last time I saw you in prison, you have been my love, my happiness, my companion in life and in my thoughts during my moment of death.” He regretted how little time they had spent together, and he recalled the “beautiful plans” that they had made to settle in the “mountains with the girls, living in peace and tranquility.” 

He tried to console her, assuring her that he was not afraid, and did not consider death “an enemy.” Though some members of the Second Front had vowed to retaliate if he was killed, Morgan told Rodríguez that he did not want anyone to seek revenge on his behalf, not even against the bodyguards who had betrayed him. “They are young and will have to fight with their conscience,” he said. “I do not want blood spilled over my cause. . . . It’s better that I die because I have defended lives. I only ask that someday the truth will be known and that my daughters will be proud of their father.” He told her, “I have great peace in my spirit,” because at least she and the girls were safe.

In fact, things were in tumult. A few days earlier, a distraught Rodríguez had learned that several of their allies were planning a last-minute assault on La Cabaña. In a kind of delirium, Rodríguez—who later cut her hair short and dyed it black, as she had when she first went into the mountains—told the wife of the Brazilian Ambassador that she needed to leave for a few days. Protect my daughters until I return, she said. The Ambassador’s wife, with whom she had grown close, pleaded with her not to go. “I have to save William,” Rodríguez said. Carrying her .32, she slipped into the trunk of a waiting car, and raced away. 

Morgan, meanwhile, was granted permission to see his girls, and one of Rodríguez’s relatives brought them to La Cabaña. Morgan was briefly allowed to talk to them, to hold them. Morgan told Rodríguez, in his letter, “Let them know someday who their father was, and what my beliefs and ideals were.” Earlier, he’d sent a note to Bill, his son from his second marriage, who was now four. Saying that he could “speak from experience, most of it hard,” Morgan told him, “Love your God—and Your Country—and Stand Up for both,” adding, “And I know that your Country . . . will Always be proud of you.” In his letter to Anne, he had said:

When the time comes for you to get married and have a family of your own. Pick a good man Baby—One with his head high but both feet on the ground—And if you find one who wants to see the world—or dreams of castles in the sky—let him see the world—honey—by himself—Possibly you may never see this letter. But if you do, remember your dad was one of those people—who saw the world—And its very hard for those who love such a man.


Not long after Rodríguez left the Brazilian Embassy, Castro’s forces smashed the plot to liberate Morgan, killing or arresting many of the conspirators. Rodríguez, meanwhile, sought refuge in a safe house, in Santa Clara.

Late in the evening on March 11th, Carreras was taken before the firing squad and shot. Five minutes afterward, Morgan—who had made his plea to speak with Castro directly—was brought outside. Morgan prayed the whole way, then removed the rosary around his neck and gave it to a priest, asking that his mother receive it. As he had written her, “I leave a love of God and country.” 

Through the floodlights, Morgan peered at the muzzles of the rifles. There was no longer any hope of escape. No more castles in the sky.

According to a prisoner’s account, a voice in the distance shouted, “Kneel and beg for your life.”

It was the last thing that Morgan could control. “I kneel for no man,” he said.

One of the executioners shot him in the right knee. The Yankee comandante tried to stay on his feet, blood spilling around him. Then he was shot in the left knee. Finally, he collapsed, and was repeatedly shot in the torso and head. His face, a witness said, was “blown off.”

“Many of the men in the patio were crying,” the prisoner who had provided medicine recalled. “The rumbling, that almost rose to the pitch of a riot, was a tribute to William Morgan’s popularity.” Rodríguez, sequestered in the safe house, did not yet know of her husband’s death, but she felt a presence in her room. “I saw William,” she says. “I felt him give me a kiss. No sound. Just the warmth of a kiss.”

Menoyo, who learned of his friend’s death while being held at an immigration detention center in McAllen, Texas, says, “It was like I lost a part of me.”

When Morgan’s lawyer called Loretta to break the news, she dropped the phone. Morgan’s daughter Anne, who was with her at the time, says, “I remember my grandmother falling down on the floor, screaming and crying. That is a memory I will never forget.” 

After Morgan was killed, Herbert Matthews sent Ernest Hemingway a letter. By then, Matthews, who once claimed that he had “invented” Castro, had seen his reputation collapse as his reporting on Cuba was exposed as gullible and partisan. In his letter, he told Hemingway, “There were even some pickets parading in front of the Times last Saturday bearing placards against me.” Matthews was rattled by Castro’s decision to execute Morgan. He reread the “very moving” statement that Morgan had sent him from the mountains, and told Hemingway, “Here was an obviously uneducated and very simple, tough guy who yet went to Cuba, as he says, to fight for the American principles of freedom and against Communism. He went on doing so for so long that he got himself executed.” Matthews said that he thought Morgan’s saga was “like an Ernest Hemingway story,” adding, “if anybody writes it, it should be you.”

On March 12th, Rodríguez, still unaware that Morgan had been executed, got in a car with a friend to go to another safe house, in Camagüey. State-security vehicles suddenly surrounded them, and Rodríguez was taken to a prison processing center, in Havana, where a sergeant greeted her as the “widow of William Morgan.” With that, she knew. She lunged at the sergeant, pounding him with her fists, then ran out to the street, through the town, as the police gave chase; she kept running, not knowing where she was going. “I ran for an hour,” she says, before the police caught her. 

Rodríguez was taken to La Cabaña, and forced to walk by the wall where Morgan had been executed. Guards then took her to another prison, locking her in a cell that had a hole in the floor for a latrine. Lizards crawled over her at night. “The guards beat me with sticks,” she recalls. “Oh, God, did they beat me.”

A month later, the newly inaugurated U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, launched the invasion of Cuba that had been approved by Eisenhower in 1960. Although America’s role was evident, Kennedy hoped to maintain deniability, and so the landing place was shifted from the town of Trinidad to the more remote Bay of Pigs—a location that would reduce the “noise level” but that was too far west to allow escape into the Escambray Mountains. At the last moment, Kennedy also cancelled a second wave of air strikes, fearing that they would betray direct U.S. involvement. 

Soon after the counter-revolutionary brigade landed on the beach, it was bombarded. The commander sent out urgent messages over his shortwave radio to American officials:



12:28 P.M.: Without jet air support cannot hold. Have no ammo left for tanks.


1:25 P.M.: Need air support immediately. Red Beach wiped out. 




Late that evening, the commander said, “I have nothing left to fight with. . . . Farewell, friends!” The line went dead. The brigade was obliterated: a hundred and fourteen members killed, and more than a thousand captured. A C.I.A. operative said that, for the rest of his life, he would have regrets about what happened, but added, “That is the echo of anybody who’s ever tried to do anything in history.” 

At the outset of the Bay of Pigs attack, Castro declared, for the first time, that Cuba was socialist. Philip Bonsal, the former Ambassador, later said of Castro, “He cannot endure any sharing of authority. . . . This drive for power is a far more constant element in his makeup than is the philosophy behind any particular revolutionary panacea he may be peddling. Castro has now attained his goal. Everything in Cuba hinges on him. He holds his job at his own pleasure.”

Menoyo was released from the Texas detention center. After writing to Morgan’s mother that “William will be our eternal symbol until we will either win or perish,” he went to Florida and founded Alpha 66, a paramilitary organization aimed at overthrowing Castro. On December 28, 1964, Menoyo and three members of the group boarded a boat in the Dominican Republic and landed at the southeastern end of Cuba. After twenty-eight days on the run in the mountains, Menoyo and his party were captured. When guards removed a blindfold that they had made Menoyo wear, he recalls, he was standing before Castro. “I knew you would come, but I also knew that I would catch you,” Castro said. Menoyo was thrown into prison, vanishing along with Rodríguez.

THE LAST FIGHT

One day not long ago, while researching Morgan’s story, I went to Miami to meet Rodríguez. An elegant woman in her mid-seventies, she had gray hair and stooped shoulders that made her seem shorter than her five feet two inches, but her face was still striking and she moved with steely purpose, as if beating back a strong wind. “I still have the spirit of a revolutionary,” she said.

After her arrest, in 1961, she spent a decade in prison. She had been a plantada, meaning someone who was “rooted,” and had refused to take classes in Marxism-Leninism or to be “rehabilitated” by the state. To protest the treatment of prisoners, she went on several hunger strikes, her body becoming an X-ray of itself, and she was often locked, virtually naked, in solitary confinement, using newspapers to keep herself warm. She read, under the faint light, the Biblical story of Job. The incessant beatings by guards left one of her eyes impaired and her veins damaged. Her daughters were raised by her parents, in Cuba, and their teachers told them that their mother and father were traitors. “When you’re in jail, it’s your family that hurts the most,” she said. The girls suffered “great trauma.”

One of her daughters once visited her in prison and screamed at her, “You abandoned us!”

Recalling those years, Rodríguez says, “I no longer know how to cry, but I cry inside.”

William’s mother, Loretta, had never met Rodríguez, but she campaigned for her release, petitioning members of Congress and drawing support from the clergy of the Catholic Church. In 1971, in response to mounting international pressure, Rodríguez was released early from prison. Though constantly followed by Cuba’s secret police, she tried to rebuild her family. Eight years later, she and her daughters, by then grown and married, arranged to fly to the United States, along with relatives. As the group boarded the plane, officials seized Rodríguez, forcing her to stay behind and pushing her to the edge of madness. 

She continued to try to get out. In 1980, Castro began the Mariel boat lift, allowing many Cubans to leave for the U.S., among them criminals and mental patients. Rodríguez claimed that she was a prostitute, but was recognized by authorities and stopped. For a month, she slept in a tent by the harbor. Finally, in August, as the last of the boats were about to leave, an official told her, “You can go tonight.” Carrying only a toothbrush and a comb, she got on a creaky, thirty-foot boat crammed with passengers.

As the boat left the harbor, she heard a loud crackling sound, like that of a firing squad. A Cuban Navy cutter was firing at them. Bullets splintered the hull, and, as the boat slowly began to sink, it seemed that Rodríguez’s life would end in a scene of cosmic cruelty. Then she heard another sound: a helicopter from the U.S. Coast Guard. Another boat was summoned, which rescued her and the other passengers.

Upon reaching Florida—her mind filled with memories of travelling there with Morgan during the Trujillo conspiracy, two decades earlier—she bent down to the ground, overcome with emotion. Taken to an immigration holding room, she told an American official, “I am Olga, the widow of the Yankee comandante, William Alexander Morgan. I was a political prisoner.” 

Rodríguez was released, and she flew to Toledo. “I knew this is where I had to be,” she says. She immediately went to see Loretta. “She wrapped me in her arms, as if she were holding a part of William,” Rodríguez recalls. Loretta, who had never much approved of William’s previous relationships, told her, “I can see why my son loved you so.” 

If Rodríguez had lived with Morgan only in the present, she now seemed imprisoned in the past. At every turn, she was forced to remember, or recordar—a word that derives from the Latin recordor, which means “to pass back through the heart.” Rodríguez often says, “The past is the past, but it’s always present.” 

Rodríguez learned that, a few years after Morgan was executed, his father died from poor health, which some family members attributed to his grief. Morgan’s son, from his second marriage, had also died, from uncertain causes. His daughter Anne had been rebellious in her youth. “I know I got that from my father,” she says. Her grandmother always wrote her on the day that Morgan was executed, to keep “his memory alive inside me.” Anne eventually married three times—“I’m an adventurous lady”—and had two children. She has kept the final letter that Morgan sent her. “I still cry when I read it,” she recalls. “That’s my daddy.” 

Morgan, in his final letter to Rodríguez, had begged her not to “let your life become lifeless and sad. If you should find someone who you should love and who respects you, marry him; because knowing that you are happy, I will be also.” In 1985, Rodríguez married a welder in Toledo. “He is a very good man,” she told me. She paused, then added, “What I had with William was . . . ” She struggled to find the words in English, then chose a Spanish phrase: “un gran amor.” A close friend of Rodríguez, Jon Richardson, told me, “She still loves William as if he’s just now coming up the mountain.” 

For more than two decades, Rodríguez, honoring a request from William’s mother, who died in 1988, has waged what she calls her “last fight”: to restore William’s U.S. citizenship and to retrieve his remains, so that he can be laid to rest in his family’s plot, in Toledo—and finally come in from the cold. “He did not deserve to die without a country,” Rodríguez says.

The U.S. government has reinstated a person’s citizenship only in rare instances, such as that of General Robert E. Lee, and for years Rodríguez’s pleas were rebuffed. In 2005, she sent a letter to President George W. Bush, saying, “Please Mr. President, may God have you make the right decision. I beg of you.” Though she was nearly seventy, she threatened to go on a hunger strike outside the White House. “I’m ready,” she told the Miami Herald. “I can go a long time without eating. This time, it’s for William.” 

In 2007, she received a letter from the State Department, acknowledging that its original finding against Morgan could not be sustained. The letter stated, “Mr. Morgan shall be deemed never to have relinquished his U.S. nationality.” 

Still, Rodríguez told me, she could not rest until Morgan had been buried in America. In 2002, Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio congresswoman, visited Cuba and received assurances from Castro that Morgan’s remains could be retrieved from the Colón Cemetery, in Havana, where he had been buried along with Carreras. Since then, Rodríguez says, she has been stymied. In a bizarre twist, Cuban officials claim that they cannot find Morgan’s bones. “They are playing a trick on me,” Rodríguez says.

She has received support for her crusade from the aging, dwindling members of Alpha 66—though Menoyo is now an outcast from the group. In 1986, after serving almost twenty-two years in prison, during which he was repeatedly tortured, Menoyo went into exile in Spain and renounced any efforts to use violence to overthrow Castro. “When you are subjected to a policy of savagery and barbarism, you come to the conclusion that you have to reject those methods, that you have to be the first to set hatred aside, otherwise it will destroy you,” he has said.

To the shock of Rodríguez and many of his friends, Menoyo permanently returned to Cuba in 2003, seeking reconciliation and a peaceful transformation. “The day I lose my dreams,” he said, “I will be lost.” Although Rodríguez still speaks fondly of Menoyo, many of his fellow-rebels now dismiss him as a traitor. 

Menoyo recently suffered an aneurysm, and when I last spoke to him by phone his voice was faint, and he had only enough strength to talk for a few minutes. He had watched Castro cling to power until 2006, when he was eighty, only to hand the Presidency over to his brother Raúl, who was seventy-five. Menoyo told me that he still hoped to see “the end of this movie.” But he did not believe that the regime would ever turn over Morgan’s bones. “Just the other day, Fidel was going around and denouncing William, saying he worked for the C.I.A.,” Menoyo said. He explained that, for the regime to address Rodríguez’s request, it would have to confront the betrayal of the revolution.

Rodríguez, however, has faith that she will prevail. When I met her in Miami, where she had travelled from Ohio to attend a meeting of Alpha 66, she said, “I can’t give up. If I have to, I will go to the cemetery and take the bones myself.” She lit a cigarette, her mottled fingers trembling. “William and I had so little time. We could never have the life we dreamed of.” For a moment, she closed her eyes, as if holding back tears. Then she said, “If I can do this for him, then we can both finally have peace, and be free.” ♦

On August 19, 2009, Tommy Davis, the chief spokesperson for the Church of Scientology International, received a letter from the film director and screenwriter Paul Haggis. “For ten months now I have been writing to ask you to make a public statement denouncing the actions of the Church of Scientology of San Diego,” Haggis wrote. Before the 2008 elections, a staff member at Scientology’s San Diego church had signed its name to an online petition supporting Proposition 8, which asserted that the State of California should sanction marriage only “between a man and a woman.” The proposition passed. As Haggis saw it, the San Diego church’s “public sponsorship of Proposition 8, which succeeded in taking away the civil rights of gay and lesbian citizens of California—rights that were granted them by the Supreme Court of our state—is a stain on the integrity of our organization and a stain on us personally. Our public association with that hate-filled legislation shames us.” Haggis wrote, “Silence is consent, Tommy. I refuse to consent.” He concluded, “I hereby resign my membership in the Church of Scientology.”

Haggis was prominent in both Scientology and Hollywood, two communities that often converge. Although he is less famous than certain other Scientologists, such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta, he had been in the organization for nearly thirty-five years. Haggis wrote the screenplay for “Million Dollar Baby,” which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2004, and he wrote and directed “Crash,” which won Best Picture the next year—the only time in Academy history that that has happened. 

Davis, too, is part of Hollywood society; his mother is Anne Archer, who starred in “Fatal Attraction” and “Patriot Games,” among other films. Before becoming Scientology’s spokesperson, Davis was a senior vice-president of the church’s Celebrity Centre International network. 

In previous correspondence with Davis, Haggis had demanded that the church publicly renounce Proposition 8. “I feel strongly about this for a number of reasons,” he wrote. “You and I both know there has been a hidden anti-gay sentiment in the church for a long time. I have been shocked on too many occasions to hear Scientologists make derogatory remarks about gay people, and then quote L.R.H. in their defense.” The initials stand for L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, whose extensive writings and lectures form the church’s scripture. Haggis related a story about Katy, the youngest of three daughters from his first marriage, who lost the friendship of a fellow-Scientologist after revealing that she was gay. The friend began warning others, “Katy is ‘1.1.’ ” The number refers to a sliding Tone Scale of emotional states that Hubbard published in a 1951 book, “The Science of Survival.” A person classified “1.1” was, Hubbard said, “Covertly Hostile”—“the most dangerous and wicked level”—and he noted that people in this state engaged in such things as casual sex, sadism, and homosexual activity. Hubbard’s Tone Scale, Haggis wrote, equated “homosexuality with being a pervert.” (Such remarks don’t appear in recent editions of the book.)

In his resignation letter, Haggis explained to Davis that, for the first time, he had explored outside perspectives on Scientology. He had read a recent exposé in a Florida newspaper, the St. Petersburg Times, which reported, among other things, that senior executives in the church had been subjecting other Scientologists to physical violence. Haggis said that he felt “dumbstruck and horrified,” adding, “Tommy, if only a fraction of these accusations are true, we are talking about serious, indefensible human and civil-rights violations.”

Online, Haggis came across an appearance that Davis had made on CNN, in May, 2008. The anchor John Roberts asked Davis about the church’s policy of “disconnection,” in which members are encouraged to separate themselves from friends or family members who criticize Scientology. Davis responded, “There’s no such thing as disconnection as you’re characterizing it. And certainly we have to understand—”

“Well, what is disconnection?” Roberts interjected.

“Scientology is a new religion,” Davis continued. “The majority of Scientologists in the world, they’re first generation. So their family members aren’t going to be Scientologists. . . . So, certainly, someone who is a Scientologist is going to respect their family members’ beliefs—”

“Well, what is disconnection?” Roberts said again.

“—and we consider family to be a building block of any society, so anything that’s characterized as disconnection or this kind of thing, it’s just not true. There isn’t any such policy.”

In his resignation letter, Haggis said, “We all know this policy exists. I didn’t have to search for verification—I didn’t have to look any further than my own home.” Haggis reminded Davis that, a few years earlier, his wife had been ordered to disconnect from her parents “because of something absolutely trivial they supposedly did twenty-five years ago when they resigned from the church. . . . Although it caused her terrible personal pain, my wife broke off all contact with them.” Haggis continued, “To see you lie so easily, I am afraid I had to ask myself: what else are you lying about?”

Haggis forwarded his resignation to more than twenty Scientologist friends, including Anne Archer, John Travolta, and Sky Dayton, the founder of EarthLink. “I felt if I sent it to my friends they’d be as horrified as I was, and they’d ask questions as well,” he says. “That turned out to be largely not the case. They were horrified that I’d send a letter like that.” 

Tommy Davis told me, “People started calling me, saying, ‘What’s this letter Paul sent you?’ ” The resignation letter had not circulated widely, but if it became public it would likely cause problems for the church. The St. Petersburg Times exposé had inspired a fresh series of hostile reports on Scientology, which has long been portrayed in the media as a cult. And, given that some well-known Scientologist actors were rumored to be closeted homosexuals, Haggis’s letter raised awkward questions about the church’s attitude toward homosexuality. Most important, Haggis wasn’t an obscure dissident; he was a celebrity, and the church, from its inception, has depended on celebrities to lend it prestige. In the past, Haggis had defended the religion; in 1997, he wrote a letter of protest after a French court ruled that a Scientology official was culpable in the suicide of a man who fell into debt after paying for church courses. “If this decision carries it sets a terrible precedent, in which no priest or minister will ever feel comfortable offering help and advice to those whose souls are tortured,” Haggis wrote. To Haggis’s friends, his resignation from the Church of Scientology felt like a very public act of betrayal. They were surprised, angry, and confused. “ ‘Destroy the letter, resign quietly’—that’s what they all wanted,” Haggis says. 

Last March, I met Haggis in New York. He was in the editing phase of his latest movie, “The Next Three Days,” a thriller starring Russell Crowe, in an office in SoHo. He sat next to a window with drawn shades, as his younger sister Jo Francis, the film’s editor, showed him a round of cuts. Haggis wore jeans and a black T-shirt. He is bald, with a trim blond beard, pale-blue eyes, and a nose that was broken in a schoolyard fight. He always has several projects going at once, and there was a barely contained feeling of frenzy. He glanced repeatedly at his watch. 

Haggis, who is fifty-seven, was preparing for two events later that week: a preview screening in New York and a trip to Haiti. He began doing charitable work in Haiti well before the 2010 earthquake, and he has raised millions of dollars for that country. He told me that he was planning to buy ten acres of land in Port-au-Prince for a new school, which he hoped to have open in the fall. (In fact, the school—the first to offer free secondary education to children from the city’s slums—opened in October.) In Hollywood, he is renowned for his ability to solicit money. The actor Ben Stiller, who has accompanied Haggis to Haiti, recalls that Haggis once raised four and a half million dollars in two hours. 

While watching the edits, Haggis fielded calls from a plastic surgeon who was planning to go on the trip, and from a priest in Haiti, Father Rick Frechette, whose organization is the main beneficiary of Haggis’s charity. “Father Rick is a lot like me—a cynical optimist,” Haggis told me. He also said of himself, “I’m a deeply broken person, and broken institutions fascinate me.” 

Haggis’s producing partner, Michael Nozik, says, “Paul likes to be contrarian. If everyone is moving left, he’ll feel the need to move right.” The actor Josh Brolin, who appeared in Haggis’s film “In the Valley of Elah” (2007), told me that Haggis “does things in extremes.” Haggis is an outspoken promoter of social justice, in the manner of Hollywood activists like Sean Penn and George Clooney. The actress Maria Bello describes him as self-deprecating and sarcastic, but also deeply compassionate. She recalls being with him in Haiti shortly after the earthquake; he was standing in the bed of a pickup truck, “with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and a big smile on his face, and absolutely no fear.” Though Haggis is passionate about his work, he can be cool toward those who are closest to him. Lauren Haggis, the second daughter from his first marriage, said that he never connected with his children. “He’s emotionally not there,” she says. “That’s funny, because his scripts are full of emotion.” 

In the editing room, Haggis felt the need for a cigarette, so we walked outside. He is ashamed of this habit, especially given that, in 2003, while directing “Crash,” he had a heart attack. After Haggis had emergency surgery, his doctor told him that it would be four or five months before he could work again: “It would be too much strain on your heart.” He replied, “Let me ask you how much stress you think I might be under as I’m sitting at home while another director is finishing my fucking film!” The doctor relented, but demanded that a nurse be on the set to monitor Haggis’s vital signs. Since then, Haggis has tried repeatedly to quit smoking. He had stopped before shooting “The Next Three Days,” but Russell Crowe was smoking, and that did him in. “There’s always a good excuse,” he admitted. Before his heart attack, he said, “I thought I was invincible.” He added, “I still do.”

Haggis had not spoken publicly about his resignation from Scientology. As we stood in a chill wind on Sixth Avenue, he was obviously uncomfortable discussing it, but he is a storyteller, and he eventually launched into a narrative.

Haggis wasn’t proud of his early years. “I was a bad kid,” he said. “I didn’t kill anybody. Not that I didn’t try.” He was born in 1953, and grew up in London, Ontario, a manufacturing town midway between Toronto and Detroit. His father, Ted, had a construction company there, which specialized in pouring concrete. His mother, Mary, a Catholic, sent Paul and his two younger sisters, Kathy and Jo, to Mass on Sundays—until she spotted their priest driving an expensive car. “God wants me to have a Cadillac,” the priest explained. Mary responded, “Then God doesn’t want us in your church anymore.”

Haggis decided at an early age to be a writer, and he made his own comic books. But he was such a poor student that his parents sent him to a strict boarding school, where the students were assigned cadet drills. He preferred to sit in his room reading Ramparts, the radical magazine from America—the place he longed to be. He committed repeated infractions, but he learned to pick locks so that he could sneak into the prefect’s office and eliminate his demerits.

After a year of this, his parents transferred him to a progressive boys’ school in Bracebridge, Ontario, where there was very little system to subvert. Haggis grew his curly blond hair to his shoulders. He discovered a mentor in his art teacher, Max Allen, who was politically radical and gay. Flouting Ontario’s strict censorship laws, Allen opened a theatre in Toronto that showed banned films; Haggis volunteered at the box office.

Haggis got caught forging a check, and he soon left school. He was drifting, hanging out with hippies and drug dealers. Two friends died from overdoses. “I had a gun pointed in my face a couple of times,” he recalls. He attended art school briefly, then quit; after taking some film classes at a community college, he dropped out of that as well. He began working in construction full time for his father. He also was the manager of a hundred-seat theatre that his father had created in an abandoned church. On Saturday nights, he set up a movie screen onstage, introducing himself and other film buffs to the works of Bergman, Hitchcock, and the French New Wave. He was so affected by Michelangelo Antonioni’s “Blow-Up” that in 1974 he decided to move to England, in order to become a fashion photographer, like the hero of the movie. That lasted less than a year.

Back in London, Ontario, he fell in love with Diane Gettas, a nurse, and they began sharing a one-bedroom apartment. He was starting to get his life together, but he was haunted by something that his grandfather had said to him on his deathbed. “He was a janitor in a bowling alley,” Haggis told me. “He had left England because of some scandal we don’t know about. He died when I was twelve or thirteen. He looked terrible. He turned to me and said, ‘I’ve wasted my life. Don’t waste yours.’ ”

One day in 1975, when he was twenty-two, Haggis was walking to a record store. When he arrived at the corner of Dundas and Waterloo Streets, a young man pressed a book into his hands. “You have a mind,” the man said. “This is the owner’s manual.” The man, whose name was Jim Logan, added, “Give me two dollars.” The book was “Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,” by L. Ron Hubbard, which was published in 1950. By the time Haggis began reading it, “Dianetics” had sold about two and a half million copies. Today, according to the church, that figure has reached more than twenty-one million.

Haggis opened the book and saw a page stamped with the words “Church of Scientology.” 

“Take me there,” Haggis said to Logan.

Haggis had heard about Scientology a couple of months earlier, from a friend who had called it a cult. The thought that he might be entering a cult didn’t bother him. In fact, he said, “it drew my interest. I tend to run toward things I don’t understand.” When he arrived at the church’s headquarters, he recalled, “it didn’t look like a cult. Two guys in a small office above Woolworth’s.” 

At the time, Haggis and Gettas were having arguments; the Scientologists told him that taking church courses would improve the relationship. “It was pitched to me as applied philosophy,” Haggis says. He and Gettas took a course together and, shortly afterward, became Hubbard Qualified Scientologists, one of the first levels in what the church calls the Bridge to Total Freedom.

The Church of Scientology says that its purpose is to transform individual lives and the world. “A civilization without insanity, without criminals and without war, where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where man is free to rise to greater heights, are the aims of Scientology,” Hubbard wrote. Scientology postulates that every person is a Thetan—an immortal spiritual being that lives through countless lifetimes. Scientologists believe that Hubbard discovered the fundamental truths of existence, and they revere him as “the source” of the religion. Hubbard’s writings offer a “technology” of spiritual advancement and self-betterment that provides “the means to attain true spiritual freedom and immortality.” A church publication declares, “Scientology works 100 percent of the time when it is properly applied to a person who sincerely desires to improve his life.” Proof of this efficacy, the church says, can be measured by the accomplishments of its adherents. “As Scientologists in all walks of life will attest, they have enjoyed greater success in their relationships, family life, jobs and professions. They take an active, vital role in life and leading roles in their communities. And participation in Scientology brings to many a broader social consciousness, manifested through meaningful contribution to charitable and social reform activities.” 

In 1955, a year after the church’s founding, an affiliated publication urged Scientologists to cultivate celebrities: “It is obvious what would happen to Scientology if prime communicators benefitting from it would mention it.” At the end of the sixties, the church established its first Celebrity Centre, in Hollywood. (There are now satellites in Paris, Vienna, Düsseldorf, Munich, Florence, London, New York, Las Vegas, and Nashville.) Over the next decade, Scientology became a potent force in Hollywood. In many respects, Haggis was typical of the recruits from that era, at least among those in the entertainment business. Many of them were young and had quit school in order to follow their dreams, but they were also smart and ambitious. The actress Kirstie Alley, for example, left the University of Kansas in 1970, during her sophomore year, to get married. Scientology, she says, helped her lose her craving for cocaine. “Without Scientology, I would be dead,” she has said. 

In 1975, the year that Haggis became a Scientologist, John Travolta, a high-school dropout, was making his first movie, “The Devil’s Rain,” in Durango, Mexico, when an actress on the set gave him a copy of “Dianetics.” “My career immediately took off,” he told a church publication. “Scientology put me into the big time.” The testimonials of such celebrities have attracted many curious seekers. In Variety, Scientology has advertised courses promising to help aspiring actors “make it in the industry.”

One of those actors, Josh Brolin, told me that, in a “moment of real desperation,” he visited the Celebrity Centre and received “auditing”—spiritual counselling. He quickly decided that Scientology wasn’t for him. But he still wonders what the religion does for celebrities like Cruise and Travolta: “Each has a good head on his shoulders, they make great business decisions, they seem to have wonderful families. Is that because they were helped by Scientology?” This is the question that makes celebrities so crucial to the religion. And, clearly, there must be something rewarding if such notable people lend their names to a belief system that is widely scorned. 

Brolin says that he once witnessed John Travolta practicing Scientology. Brolin was at a dinner party in Los Angeles with Travolta and Marlon Brando. Brando arrived with a cut on his leg, and explained that he had injured himself while helping a stranded motorist on the Pacific Coast Highway. He was in pain. Travolta offered to help, saying that he had just reached a new level in Scientology. Travolta touched Brando’s leg and Brando closed his eyes. “I watched this process going on—it was very physical,” Brolin recalls. “I was thinking, This is really fucking bizarre! Then, after ten minutes, Brando opens his eyes and says, ‘That really helped. I actually feel different!’ ” (Travolta, through a lawyer, called this account “pure fabrication.”)

Many Hollywood actors were drawn into the church by a friend or by reading “Dianetics”; a surprising number of them, though, came through the Beverly Hills Playhouse. For decades, the resident acting coach there was Milton Katselas, and he taught hundreds of future stars, including Ted Danson, Michelle Pfeiffer, and George Clooney. “Most of Hollywood went through that class,” Anne Archer told me. In 1974, two years after her son Tommy Davis was born, she began studying with Katselas. She was a young mother in a dissolving marriage, coming off a television series (“Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice”) that had been cancelled after one season. Katselas had a transformative effect. She recalled discussions “about life, people, and behavior,” and said that Katselas “said some things in class that were really smart.” Some of the other students told her that Katselas was a Scientologist, so she began the Life Repair program at the Celebrity Centre. “I went two or three times a week, probably for a couple of weeks,” she said. “I remember walking out of the building and walking down the street toward my car and I felt like my feet were not touching the ground. And I said to myself, ‘My God, this is the happiest I’ve ever been in my entire life. I’ve finally found something that works.’ ” She added, “Life didn’t seem so hard anymore. I was back in the driver’s seat.” 

Jim Gordon, a veteran police officer in Los Angeles, and also an aspiring actor, spent ten years at the Playhouse, starting in 1990. He told me that Scientology “recruited a ton of kids out of that school.” Like Scientology, the Playhouse presented a strict hierarchy of study; under Katselas’s tutelage, students graduated from one level to the next. As Gordon advanced within the Playhouse, he began recognizing many students from the roles they were getting in Hollywood. “You see a lot of people you know from TV,” Gordon says. He began feeling the pull of the church. “When you started off, they weren’t really pushing it, but as you progressed through the Playhouse’s levels Scientology became more of a focus,” he told me. After a few years, he joined. Like the courses at the Playhouse, Scientology offered actors a method that they could apply to both their lives and their careers.

Not long after Gordon became a Scientologist, he was asked to serve as an “ethics officer” at the Playhouse, monitoring the progress of other students and counselling those who were having trouble. He was good at pinpointing students who were struggling. “It’s almost like picking out the wounded chicks,” he says. He sometimes urged a student to meet with the senior ethics officer at the Playhouse, a Scientologist who often recommended courses at the Celebrity Centre. “My job was to keep the students active and make sure they were not being suppressed,” Gordon says. In the rhetoric of Scientology, “suppressive persons”—or S.P.s—block an individual’s spiritual progress. Implicitly, the message to the students was that success awaited them if only they could sweep away the impediments to stardom, including S.P.s. Katselas received a ten-per-cent commission from the church on the money contributed by his students.

Katselas died in 2008, and Scientology no longer has a connection with the Beverly Hills Playhouse. Anne Archer told me that the reputation of Katselas’s class as, in Gordon’s words, a “Scientology clearinghouse” is overblown. “His classes averaged about fifty or sixty people, and there would be maybe seven to ten people in it who would be Scientologists,” she says. But the list of Scientologists who have studied at the Playhouse is long—it includes Jenna Elfman, Giovanni Ribisi, and Jason Lee—and the many protégés Katselas left behind helped cement the relationship between Hollywood and the church.

Haggis and I travelled together to L.A., where he was presenting “The Next Three Days” to the studio. During the flight, I asked him how high he had gone in Scientology. “All the way to the top,” he said. Since the early eighties, he had been an Operating Thetan VII, which was the highest level available when he became affiliated with the church. (In 1988, a new level, O.T. VIII, was introduced to members; it required study at sea, and Haggis declined to pursue it.) He had made his ascent by buying “intensives”—bundled hours of auditing, at a discount rate. “It wasn’t so expensive back then,” he said. 

David S. Touretzky, a computer-science professor at Carnegie Mellon University, has done extensive research on Scientology. (He is not a defector.) He estimates that the coursework alone now costs nearly three hundred thousand dollars, and, with the additional auditing and contributions expected of upper-level members, the cumulative cost of the coursework may exceed half a million dollars. (The church says that there are no fixed fees, adding, “Donations requested for ‘courses’ at Church of Scientology begin at $50 and could never possibly reach the amount suggested.”)

I asked Haggis why he had aligned himself with a religion that so many have disparaged. “I identify with the underdog,” he said. “I have a perverse pride in being a member of a group that people shun.” For Haggis, who likes to see himself as a man of the people, his affiliation with Scientology felt like a way of standing with the marginalized and the oppressed. The church itself often hits this note, making frequent statements in support of human rights and religious freedom. Haggis’s experience in Scientology, though, was hardly egalitarian: he accepted the privileges of the Celebrity Centre, which offers notables a private entrance, a V.I.P. lounge, separate facilities for auditing, and other perks. Indeed, much of the appeal of Scientology is the overt élitism that it promotes among its members, especially celebrities. Haggis was struck by another paradox: “Here I was in this very structured organization, but I always thought of myself as a freethinker and an iconoclast.” 

During our conversations, we spoke about some events that had stained the reputation of the church while he was a member. For example, there was the death of Lisa McPherson, a Scientologist who died after a mental breakdown, in 1995. She had rear-ended a car in Clearwater, Florida—where Scientology has its spiritual headquarters—and then stripped off her clothes and wandered naked down the street. She was taken to a hospital, but, in the company of several other Scientologists, she checked out, against doctors’ advice. (The church considers psychiatry an evil profession.) McPherson spent the next seventeen days being subjected to church remedies, such as doses of vitamins and attempts to feed her with a turkey baster. She became comatose, and she died of a pulmonary embolism before church members finally brought her to the hospital. The medical examiner in the case, Joan Wood, initially ruled that the cause of death was undetermined, but she told a reporter, “This is the most severe case of dehydration I’ve ever seen.” The State of Florida filed charges against the church. In February, 2000, under withering questioning from experts hired by the church, Wood declared that the death was “accidental.” The charges were dropped and Wood resigned.

Haggis said that, at the time, he had chosen not to learn the details of McPherson’s death. “I had such a lack of curiosity when I was inside,” Haggis said. “It’s stunning to me, because I’m such a curious person.” He said that he had been “somewhere between uninterested in looking and afraid of looking.” His life was comfortable, he liked his circle of friends, and he didn’t want to upset the balance. It was also easy to dismiss people who quit the church. As he put it, “There’s always disgruntled folks who say all sorts of things.” He was now ashamed of this willed myopia, which, he noted, clashed with what he understood to be the ethic of Scientology: “Hubbard says that there is a relationship between knowledge, responsibility, and control, and as soon as you know something you have a responsibility to act. And, if you don’t, shame on you.” 

Since resigning, Haggis had been wondering why it took him so long to leave. In an e-mail exchange, I noted that higher-level Scientologists are supposed to be free of neuroses and allergies, and resistant to the common cold. “Dianetics” also promises heightened powers of intelligence and perception. Haggis had told me that he fell far short of this goal. “Did you feel it was your fault?” I asked. Haggis responded that, because the auditing took place over a number of years, it was easy to believe that he might actually be smarter and wiser because of it, just as that might be true after years of therapy. “It is all so subjective, how is one supposed to know?” he wrote. “How does it feel to be smarter today than you were two months ago? . . . But yes, I always felt false.” 

He noted that a Scientologist hearing this would feel, with some justification, that he had misled his auditors about his progress. But, after hundreds of hours of auditing sessions, he said, “I remember feeling I just wanted it over. I felt it wasn’t working, and figured that could be my fault, but did not want the hours of ‘repair auditing’ that they would tell me I needed to fix it. So I just went along, to my shame. I did what was easy . . . without asking them, or myself, any hard questions.”

When Haggis first turned to Scientology, he considered himself an atheist. Scientology seemed to him less a religion than a set of useful principles for living. He mentioned the ARC Triangle; “ARC” stands for “Affinity, Reality, and Communication.” Affinity, in this formulation, means the emotional response that partners have toward each other; reality is the area of common agreement. Together, these contribute to the flow of communication. “The three parts together equal understanding,” Haggis said. “If you’re having a disagreement with someone, your affinity drops quickly. Your mutual reality is shattered. Your communication becomes more halted. You begin to talk over each other. There’s less and less understanding. But all you need to do is to raise one part of the triangle and you increase the others as well. I still use that.” 

Some aspects of Scientology baffled him. He hadn’t been able to get through “Dianetics”: “I read about thirty pages. I thought it was impenetrable.” But much of the coursework gave him a feeling of accomplishment. He was soon commuting from London, Ontario, to Toronto to take more advanced courses, and, in 1976, he travelled to Los Angeles for the first time. He checked in at the old Chateau Élysée, on Franklin Avenue. Clark Gable and Katharine Hepburn had once stayed there, but when Haggis arrived it was a run-down church retreat called the Manor Hotel. (It has since been spectacularly renovated and turned into the flagship Celebrity Centre.) “I had a little apartment with a kitchen I could write in,” he recalls. “There was a feeling of camaraderie that was something I’d never experienced—all these atheists looking for something to believe in, and all these loners looking for a club to join.” 

Recruits had a sense of boundless possibility. Mystical powers were forecast; out-of-body experiences were to be expected; fundamental secrets were to be revealed. Hubbard had boasted that Scientology had raised some people’s I.Q. one point for every hour of auditing. “Our most spectacular feat was raising a boy from 83 I.Q. to 212,” he told the Saturday Evening Post, in 1964. 

At the Manor Hotel, Haggis went “Clear.” The concept comes from “Dianetics”; it is where you start if you want to ascend to the upper peaks of Scientology. A person who becomes Clear is “adaptable to and able to change his environment,” Hubbard writes. “His ethical and moral standards are high, his ability to seek and experience pleasure is great. His personality is heightened and he is creative and constructive.” Someone who is Clear is less susceptible to disease and is free of neuroses, compulsions, repressions, and psychosomatic illnesses. “The dianetic Clear is to a current normal individual as the current normal is to the severely insane.” 

Going Clear “was not life-changing,” Haggis says. “It wasn’t, like, ‘Oh, my God, I can fly!’ ” At every level of advancement, he was encouraged to write a “success story” saying how effective his training had been. He had read many such stories by other Scientologists, and they felt “overly effusive, done in part to convince yourself, but also slanted toward giving somebody upstairs approval for you to go on to the next level.” 

In 1977, Haggis returned to Canada to continue working for his father, who could see that his son was struggling. Ted Haggis asked him what he wanted to do with his life. Haggis said that he wanted to be a writer. His father recalls, “I said, ‘Well, there are only two places to do that, New York and Los Angeles. Pick one, and I’ll keep you on the payroll for a year.’ Paul said, ‘I think I’ll go to L.A., because it’s warmer.’ ” 

Soon after this conversation, Haggis and Diane Gettas got married. Two months later, they loaded up his brown Camaro and drove to Los Angeles, where he got a job moving furniture. He and Diane lived in an apartment with her brother, Gregg, and three other people. In 1978, Diane gave birth to their first child, Alissa. Haggis was spending much of his time and money taking advanced courses and being audited, which involved the use of an electropsychometer, or E-Meter. The device, often compared in the press to a polygraph, measures the bodily changes in electrical resistance that occur when a person answers questions posed by an auditor. (“Thoughts have a small amount of mass,” the church contends in a statement. “These are the changes measured.”) In 1952, Hubbard said of the E-Meter, “It gives Man his first keen look into the heads and hearts of his fellows.” The Food and Drug Administration has compelled the church to declare that the instrument has no curative powers and is ineffective in diagnosing or treating disease. 

During auditing, Haggis grasped a cylindrical electrode in each hand; when he first joined Scientology, the electrodes were empty soup cans. An imperceptible electrical charge ran from the meter through his body. The auditor asked systematic questions aimed at detecting sources of “spiritual distress.” Whenever Haggis gave an answer that prompted the E-Meter’s needle to jump, that subject became an area of concentration until the auditor was satisfied that Haggis was free of the emotional consequences of the troubling experience.

Haggis found the E-Meter surprisingly responsive. It seemed to gauge the kinds of thoughts he was having—whether they were angry or happy, or if he was hiding something. The auditor often probed for what Scientologists call “earlier similars.” Haggis explained, “If you’re having a fight with your girlfriend, the auditor will ask, ‘Can you remember an earlier time when something like this happened?’ And if you do then he’ll ask, ‘What about a time before that? And a time before that?’ ” Often, the process leads participants to recall past lives. The goal is to uncover and neutralize the emotional memories that are plaguing one’s behavior. 

Although Haggis never believed in reincarnation, he says, “I did experience gains. I would feel relief from arguments I’d had with my dad, things I’d done as a teen-ager that I didn’t feel good about. I think I did, in some ways, become a better person. I did develop more empathy for others.” Then again, he admitted, “I tried to find ways to be a better husband, but I never really did. I was still the selfish bastard I always was.” 

Haggis was moving furniture during the day and taking photographs for church yearbooks on the weekends. At night, he wrote scripts on spec. He met Skip Press, another young writer who was a Scientologist. Press had read one of Haggis’s scripts—an episode of “Welcome Back, Kotter” that he was trying to get to the show’s star, John Travolta. Haggis and Press started hanging out with other aspiring writers and directors who were involved with Scientology. “We would meet at a restaurant across from the Celebrity Centre called Two Dollar Bill’s,” Press recalls. Chick Corea and other musicians associated with the church played there. Haggis and a friend from this circle eventually got a job writing for cartoons, including “Scooby-Doo” and “Richie Rich.” 

By now, Haggis had begun advancing through the upper levels of Scientology. The church defines an Operating Thetan as “one who can handle things without having to use a body or physical means.” An editorial in a 1959 issue of the Scientology magazine Ability notes that “neither Lord Buddha nor Jesus Christ were O.T.s, according to the evidence. They were just a shade above Clear.” According to several copies of church documents that have been leaked online, Hubbard’s handwritten instructions for the first level list thirteen mental exercises that attune practitioners to their relationship with others, such as “Note several large and several small male bodies until you have a cognition. Note it down.” In the second level, Scientologists engage in exercises and visualizations that explore oppositional forces: 



Laughter comes from the rear half and calm from the front half simultaneously. Then they reverse. It gives one a sensation of total disagreement. The trick is to conceive of both at the same time. This tends to knock one out.




Haggis didn’t have a strong reaction to the material, but then he wasn’t expecting anything too profound. Everyone knew that the big revelations resided in level O.T. III. 

Hubbard called this level the Wall of Fire. He said, “The material involved in this sector is so vicious, that it is carefully arranged to kill anyone if he discovers the exact truth of it. . . . I am very sure that I was the first one that ever did live through any attempt to attain that material.” The O.T. III candidate is expected to free himself from being overwhelmed by the disembodied, emotionally wounded spirits that have been implanted inside his body. Bruce Hines, a former high-level Scientology auditor who is now a research physicist at the University of Colorado, explained to me, “Most of the upper levels are involved in exorcising these spirits.” 

“The process of induction is so long and slow that you really do convince yourself of the truth of some of these things that don’t make sense,” Haggis told me. Although he refused to specify the contents of O.T. materials, on the ground that it offended Scientologists, he said, “If they’d sprung this stuff on me when I first walked in the door, I just would have laughed and left right away.” But by the time Haggis approached the O.T. III material he’d already been through several years of auditing. His wife was deeply involved in the church, as was his sister Kathy. Moreover, his first writing jobs had come through Scientology connections. He was now entrenched in the community. Success stories in the Scientology magazine Advance! added an aura of reality to the church’s claims. Haggis admits, “I was looking forward to enhanced abilities.” Moreover, he had invested a lot of money in the program. The incentive to believe was high. 

In the late seventies, the O.T. material was still quite secret. There was no Google, and Scientology’s confidential scriptures had not yet circulated, let alone been produced in court or parodied on “South Park.” “You were told that this information, if released, would cause serious damage to people,” Haggis told me. 

Carrying an empty, locked briefcase, Haggis went to the Advanced Organization building in Los Angeles, where the material was held. A supervisor then handed him a folder, which Haggis put in the briefcase. He entered a study room, where he finally got to examine the secret document—a couple of pages, in Hubbard’s bold scrawl. After a few minutes, he returned to the supervisor. 

“I don’t understand,” Haggis said.

“Do you know the words?” the supervisor asked.

“I know the words, I just don’t understand.”

“Go back and read it again,” the supervisor suggested.

Haggis did so. In a moment, he returned. “Is this a metaphor?” he asked the supervisor.

“No,” the supervisor responded. “It is what it is. Do the actions that are required.”

Maybe it’s an insanity test, Haggis thought—if you believe it, you’re automatically kicked out. “I sat with that for a while,” he says. But when he read it again he decided, “This is madness.”

The many discrepancies between L. Ron Hubbard’s legend and his life have overshadowed the fact that he was a fascinating man: an explorer, a best-selling author, and the founder of one of the few new religious movements of the twentieth century to have survived into the twenty-first. There are several unauthorized Hubbard biographies—most notably, Russell Miller’s “Bare-Faced Messiah,” Jon Atack’s “A Piece of Blue Sky,” and Bent Corydon’s “L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?” All rely on stolen materials and the accounts of defectors, and the church claims that they present a false and fabricated picture of Hubbard’s life. For years, the church has had a contract with a biographer, Dan Sherman, to chronicle the founder’s life, but there is still no authorized book, and the church refused to let me talk to Sherman. (“He’s busy,” Davis told me.) The tug-of-war between Scientologists and anti-Scientologists over Hubbard’s legacy has created two swollen archetypes: the most important person who ever lived and the world’s greatest con man. Hubbard was certainly grandiose, but to label him merely a fraud is to ignore the complexity of his character. 

Hubbard was born in Tilden, Nebraska, in 1911. His father, a naval officer, was often away, and Hubbard spent part of his childhood on his grandparents’ ranch, in Montana. When his father got posted to Guam, in 1927, Hubbard made two trips to see him. According to Hubbard, on the second trip he continued on to Asia, where he visited the Buddhist lamaseries in the Western Hills of China, “watching monks meditate for weeks on end.” 

In 1933, Hubbard married Margaret Grubb, whom he called Polly; their first child, Lafayette, was born the following year. He visited Hollywood, and began getting work as a screenwriter, very much as Paul Haggis did some forty years later. Hubbard worked on serials for Columbia Pictures, including one called “The Secret of Treasure Island.” But much of his energy was devoted to publishing stories, often under pseudonyms, in pulp magazines such as Astounding Science Fiction. 

During the Second World War, Hubbard served in the U.S. Navy, and he later wrote that he was gravely injured in battle: “Blinded with injured optic nerves and lame with physical injuries to hip and back at the end of World War II, I faced an almost nonexistent future. I was abandoned by family and friends as a supposedly hopeless cripple.” While languishing in a military hospital in Oakland, California, he said, he fully healed himself, using techniques that became the foundation of Scientology. “I had no one to help me; what I had to know I had to find out,” he wrote in an essay titled “My Philosophy.” “And it’s quite a trick studying when you cannot see.” In some editions of Hubbard’s book “The Fundamentals of Thought,” published in 1956, a note on the author says, “It is a matter of medical record that he has twice been pronounced dead.” 

After the war, Hubbard’s marriage dissolved, and he moved to Pasadena, where he became the housemate of Jack Parsons, a rocket scientist who belonged to an occult society called the Ordo Templi Orientis. An atmosphere of hedonism pervaded the house; Parsons hosted gatherings involving “sex magick” rituals. 

In a 1946 letter, Parsons described Hubbard: “He is a gentleman, red hair, green eyes, honest and intelligent.” Parsons then mentioned his wife’s sister, Betty Northrup, with whom he had been having an affair. “Although Betty and I are still friendly, she has transferred her sexual affections to Ron.” One day, Hubbard and Northrup ran off together. In the official Scientology literature, it is claimed that Hubbard was assigned by naval intelligence to infiltrate Parsons’s occult group. “Hubbard broke up black magic in America,” the church said in a statement. 

Hubbard and Northrup ended up in Los Angeles. He continued writing for the pulps, but he had larger ambitions. He began codifying a system of self-betterment, and set up an office near the corner of La Brea and Sunset, where he tested his techniques on the actors, directors, and writers he encountered. He named his system Dianetics.

The book “Dianetics” appeared in May, 1950, and spent twenty-eight weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. Written in a bluff, quirky style and overrun with footnotes that do little to substantiate its findings, “Dianetics” purports to identify the source of self-destructive behavior—the “reactive mind,” a kind of data bank that is filled with traumatic memories called “engrams,” and that is the source of nightmares, insecurities, irrational fears, and psychosomatic illnesses. The object of Dianetics is to drain the engrams of their painful, damaging qualities and eliminate the reactive mind, leaving a person “Clear.” 

Dianetics, Hubbard said, was a “precision science.” He offered his findings to the American Psychiatric Association and the American Medical Association but was spurned; he subsequently portrayed psychiatry and psychology as demonic competitors. He once wrote that if psychiatrists “had the power to torture and kill everyone they would do so.” 

Scientists dismissed Hubbard’s book, but hundreds of Dianetics groups sprang up across the U.S. and abroad. The Church of Scientology was officially founded in Los Angeles in February, 1954, by several devoted followers of Hubbard’s work. 

In 1966, Hubbard—who by then had met and married another woman, Mary Sue Whipp—set sail with a handful of Scientologists. The church says that being at sea provided a “distraction-free environment,” allowing Hubbard “to continue his research into the upper levels of spiritual awareness.” Within a year, he had acquired several oceangoing vessels. He staffed the ships with volunteers, many of them teen-agers, who called themselves the Sea Organization. Hubbard and his followers cruised the Mediterranean searching for loot he had stored in previous lifetimes. (The church denies this.) The defector Janis Grady, a former Sea Org member, told me, “I was on the bridge with him, sailing past Greek islands. There were crosses lining one island. He told me that under each cross is buried treasure.” 

The Sea Org became the church’s equivalent of a religious order. The group now has six thousand members. They perform tasks such as counselling, maintaining the church’s vast property holdings, and publishing its official literature. Sea Org initiates—some of whom are children—sign contracts for up to a billion years of service. They get a small weekly stipend and receive free auditing and coursework. Sea Org members can marry, but they must agree not to raise children while in the organization. 

As Scientology grew, it was increasingly attacked. In 1963, the Los Angeles Times called it a “pseudo-scientific cult.” The church attracted dozens of lawsuits, largely from ex-parishioners. In 1980, Hubbard disappeared from public view. Although there were rumors that he was dead, he was actually driving around the Pacific Northwest in a motor home. He returned to writing science fiction and produced a ten-volume work, “Mission Earth,” each volume of which was a best-seller. In 1983, he settled quietly on a horse farm in Creston, California. 

Around that time, Paul Haggis received a message from the church about a film project. Hubbard had written a treatment for a script titled “Influencing the Planet” and, apparently, intended to direct it. The film was supposed to demonstrate the range of Hubbard’s efforts to improve civilization. With another Scientologist, Haggis completed a script, which he called “quite dreadful.” Hubbard sent him notes on the draft, but no film by that name was ever released.

In 1985, with Hubbard in seclusion, the church faced two of its most difficult court challenges. In Los Angeles, a former Sea Org member, Lawrence Wollersheim, sought twenty-five million dollars for “infliction of emotional injury.” He claimed that he had been kept for eighteen hours a day in the hold of a ship docked in Long Beach, and deprived of adequate sleep and food. 

That October, the litigants filed O.T. III materials in court. Fifteen hundred Scientologists crowded into the courthouse, trying to block access to the documents. The church, which considers it sacrilegious for the uninitiated to read its confidential scriptures, got a restraining order, but the Los Angeles Times obtained a copy of the material and printed a summary. Suddenly, the secrets that had stunned Paul Haggis in a locked room were public knowledge.

“A major cause of mankind’s problems began 75 million years ago,” the Times wrote, when the planet Earth, then called Teegeeack, was part of a confederation of ninety planets under the leadership of a despotic ruler named Xenu. “Then, as now, the materials state, the chief problem was overpopulation.” Xenu decided “to take radical measures.” The documents explained that surplus beings were transported to volcanoes on Earth. “The documents state that H-bombs far more powerful than any in existence today were dropped on these volcanoes, destroying the people but freeing their spirits—called thetans—which attached themselves to one another in clusters.” Those spirits were “trapped in a compound of frozen alcohol and glycol,” then “implanted” with “the seed of aberrant behavior.” The Times account concluded, “When people die, these clusters attach to other humans and keep perpetuating themselves.” 

The jury awarded Wollersheim thirty million dollars. (Eventually, an appellate court reduced the judgment to two and a half million.) The secret O.T. III documents remained sealed, but the Times’ report had already circulated widely, and the church was met with derision all over the world. 

The other court challenge in 1985 involved Julie Christofferson-Titchbourne, a defector who argued that the church had falsely claimed that Scientology would improve her intelligence, and even her eyesight. In a courtroom in Portland, she said that Hubbard had been portrayed to her as a nuclear physicist; in fact, he had failed to graduate from George Washington University. As for Hubbard’s claim that he had cured himself of grave injuries in the Second World War, the plaintiff’s evidence indicated that he had never been wounded in battle. Witnesses for the plaintiff testified that, in one six-month period in 1982, the church had transferred millions of dollars to Hubbard through a Liberian corporation. The church denied this, and said that Hubbard’s income was generated by his book sales. 

The jury sided with Christofferson-Titchbourne, awarding her thirty-nine million dollars. Scientologists streamed into Portland to protest. They carried banners advocating religious freedom and sang “We Shall Overcome.” Scientology celebrities, including John Travolta, showed up; Chick Corea played a concert in a public park. Haggis, who was writing for the NBC series “The Facts of Life” at the time, came and was drafted to write speeches. “I wasn’t a celebrity—I was a lowly sitcom writer,” he says. He stayed for four days. 

The judge declared a mistrial, saying that Christofferson-Titchbourne’s lawyers had presented prejudicial arguments. It was one of the greatest triumphs in Scientology’s history, and the church members who had gone to Portland felt an enduring sense of kinship. (A year and a half later, the church settled with Christofferson-Titchbourne for an undisclosed sum.)

In 1986, Hubbard died, of a stroke, in his motor home. He was seventy-four. Two weeks later, Scientologists gathered in the Hollywood Palladium for a special announcement. A young man, David Miscavige, stepped onto the stage. Short, trim, and muscular, with brown hair and sharp features, Miscavige announced to the assembled Scientologists that, for the past six years, Hubbard had been investigating new, higher O.T. levels. “He has now moved on to the next level,” Miscavige said. “It’s a level beyond anything any of us ever imagined. This level is, in fact, done in an exterior state. Meaning that it is done completely exterior from the body. Thus, at twenty-hundred hours, the twenty-fourth of January, A.D. 36”—that is, thirty-six years after the publication of “Dianetics”—“L. Ron Hubbard discarded the body he had used in this lifetime.” Miscavige began clapping, and led the crowd in an ovation, shouting, “Hip hip hooray!” 

Miscavige was a Scientology prodigy from the Philadelphia area. He claimed that, growing up, he had been sickly, and struggled with bad asthma; Dianetics counselling had dramatically alleviated the symptoms. As he puts it, he “experienced a miracle.” He decided to devote his life to the religion. He had gone Clear by the age of fifteen, and the next year he dropped out of high school to join the Sea Org. He became an executive assistant to Hubbard, who gave him special tutoring in photography and cinematography. When Hubbard went into seclusion, in 1980, Miscavige was one of the few people who maintained close contact with him. With Hubbard’s death, the curtain rose on a man who was going to impose his personality on an organization facing its greatest test, the death of its charismatic founder. Miscavige was twenty-five years old.

In 1986, Haggis appeared on the cover of the Scientology magazine Celebrity. The accompanying article lauded his rising influence in Hollywood. He had escaped the cartoon ghetto after selling a script to “The Love Boat.” He had climbed the ladder of network television, writing movies of the week and children’s shows before settling into sitcoms. He worked on “Diff’rent Strokes” and “One Day at a Time,” then became the executive producer of “The Facts of Life.” The magazine noted, “He is one of the few writers in Hollywood who has major credits in all genres: comedy, suspense, human drama, animation.” 

In the article, Haggis said of Scientology, “What excited me about the technology was that you could actually handle life, and your problems, and not have them handle you.” He added, “I also liked the motto, ‘Scientology makes the able more able.’ ” He credited the church for improving his relationship with Gettas. “Instead of fighting (we did a lot of that before Scientology philosophy) we now talk things out, listen to each other and apply Scientology technology to our problems.” 

Haggis told Celebrity that he had recently gone through the Purification Rundown, a program intended to eliminate body toxins that form a “biochemical barrier to spiritual well-being.” For an average of three weeks, participants undergo a lengthy daily regimen combining sauna visits, exercise, and huge doses of vitamins, especially niacin. According to a forthcoming book, “Inside Scientology,” by the journalist Janet Reitman, the sauna sessions can last up to five hours a day. In the interview, Haggis recalled being skeptical—“My idea of doing good for my body was smoking low-tar cigarettes”—but said that the Purification Rundown “was WONDERFUL.” He went on, “I really did feel more alert and more aware and more at ease—I wasn’t running in six directions to get something done, or bouncing off the walls when something went wrong.” Haggis mentioned that he had taken drugs when he was young. “Getting rid of all those residual toxins and medicines and drugs really had an effect,” he said. “After completing the rundown I drank a diet cola and suddenly could really taste it: every single chemical!” He recommended the Rundown to others, including his mother, who at the time was seriously ill. He also persuaded a young writer on his staff to take the course, in order to wean herself from various medications. “She could tell Scientology worked by the example I set,” Haggis told the magazine. “That made me feel very good.”

Privately, he told me, he remained troubled by the church’s theology, which struck him as “intergalactic spirituality.” He was grateful, however, to have an auditor who was “really smart, sweet, thoughtful. I could always go to talk to him.” The confessionals were helpful. “It just felt better to get things off my chest.” Even after his incredulous reaction to O.T. III, he continued to “move up” the Bridge. He saw so many intelligent people on the path, and expected that his concerns would be addressed in future levels. He told himself, “Maybe there is something, and I’m just missing it.” He felt unsettled by the lack of irony among many fellow-Scientologists—an inability to laugh at themselves, which seemed at odds with the character of Hubbard himself. When Haggis felt doubts about the religion, he recalled 16-mm. films he had seen of Hubbard’s lectures from the fifties and sixties. “He had this amazing buoyancy,” Haggis says. “He had a deadpan humor and this sense of himself that seemed to say, ‘Yes, I am fully aware that I might be mad, but I also might be on to something.’ ”

Haggis finally reached the top of the Operating Thetan pyramid. According to documents obtained by WikiLeaks, the activist group run by Julian Assange, the final exercise is: “Go out to a park, train station or other busy area. Practice placing an intention into individuals until you can successfully and easily place an intention into or on a Being and/or a body.” 

Haggis expected that, as an O.T. VII, he would feel a sense of accomplishment, but he remained confused and unsatisfied. He thought that Hubbard was “brilliant in so many ways,” and that the failing must be his. At one point, he confided to a minister in the church that he didn’t think he should be a Scientologist. She told him, “There are all sorts of Scientologists,” just as there are all sorts of Jews and Christians, with varying levels of faith. The implication, Haggis said, was that he could “pick and choose” which tenets of Scientology to believe.

Haggis was a workaholic, and as his career took off he spent less and less time with his family. “He never got home till late at night or early in the morning,” his oldest daughter, Alissa, said. “All the time I ever spent with him was on the set.” Haggis frequently brought his daughters to work and assigned them odd jobs; Alissa earned her Directors Guild card when she was fifteen. 

In 1987, Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, the creators of the new series “thirtysomething,” hired Haggis to write scripts. When I talked to them recently, Herskovitz recalled, “Paul walked in the door and said, ‘I love the fact that you guys are doing a show all about emotions. I don’t like talking about my emotions.’ ” In the show’s first season, one of Haggis’s scripts won an Emmy. Since he rarely discussed his religion, his bosses were surprised to learn of his affiliation. Herskovitz told me, “The thing about Paul is his particular sense of humor, which is ironic, self-deprecating—”

“And raw!” Zwick interjected.

“It’s not a sense of humor you often encounter among people who believe in Scientology,” Herskovitz continued. “His way of looking at life didn’t have that sort of straight-on, unambiguous, unambivalent view that so many Scientologists project.” 

Observing Zwick and Herskovitz at work got Haggis interested in directing, and when the church asked him to make a thirty-second ad about Dianetics he seized the chance. He was determined to avoid the usual claim that Dianetics offered a triumphal march toward enlightenment. He shot a group of Scientologists talking about the practical ways that they had used Dianetics. “It was very naturalistic,” he recalls. Church authorities hated it. “They thought it looked like an A.A. meeting.” The spot never aired.

In 1992, he helped out on the pilot for “Walker, Texas Ranger,” a new series starring Chuck Norris. It ran for eight seasons and was broadcast in a hundred countries. Haggis was credited as a co-creator. “It was the most successful thing I ever did,” he says. “Two weeks of work. They never even used my script!” 

With his growing accomplishments and wealth, Haggis became a bigger prize for the church. In 1988, Scientology sponsored a Dianetics car in the Indianapolis 500. David Miscavige was at the race. It was one of the few times that he and Haggis met. They sat near each other at a Scientology-sponsored dinner event before the race. “Paul takes no shit from anybody,” the organizer of the event recalled. Several times when Miscavige made some comment during the dinner, the organizer said, “Paul challenged him in a lighthearted way.” His tone was perceived as insufficiently deferential; afterward, Miscavige demanded to know why Haggis had been invited. (Miscavige declined requests to speak to me, and Tommy Davis says that Miscavige did not attend the event.) The organizer told me, “You have to understand: no one challenges David Miscavige.”

Haggis’s marriage had long been troubled, and he and his wife were entering a final state of estrangement. One day, Haggis flew to New York with a casting director who was also a Scientologist. They shared a kiss. Haggis felt bad about it, and confessed to it during an “ethics” session. He was given instruction on how to fix the problem. It didn’t work. He had a series of liaisons, each of which he confessed. Yet, perhaps because of his fame, he was not made to atone for what Scientologists call “out ethics” behavior.

Haggis and Gettas began a divorce battle that lasted nine years. Their three girls lived with Gettas, visiting Haggis occasionally. Gettas enrolled them in private schools that used Hubbard’s educational system, which is called Study Tech. It is one of the more grounded systems that he developed. There are three central elements. One is the use of clay, or other materials, to help make difficult concepts less abstract. Alissa explains, “If I’m learning the idea of how an atom looks, I’d make an atom out of clay.” A second concept is making sure that students don’t face “too steep a gradient,” in Hubbard’s words. “The schools are set up so that you don’t go on to the next level until you completely understand the material,” Alissa says. The third element is the frequent use of a dictionary to eliminate misunderstandings. “It’s really important to understand the words you’re using.”

Lauren, the middle sister, initially struggled in school. “I was illiterate until I was eleven,” she told me. Somehow, that fact escaped her parents. “I assume it was because of the divorce,” she says.

When the divorce became final, in 1997, Haggis and Gettas were ordered by the court to undergo psychological evaluations—a procedure abhorred by Scientologists. The court then determined that Haggis should have full custody of the children. 

His daughters were resentful. They had lived their entire lives with their mother. “I didn’t even know why he wanted us,” Lauren says. “I didn’t really know him.”

Haggis put his daughters in an ordinary private school, but that lasted only six months. The girls weren’t entirely comfortable talking to people who weren’t Scientologists, and basic things like multiple-choice tests were unfamiliar. At a regular school, they felt like outsiders. “The first thing I noticed that I did, that others didn’t, is the Contact,” Alissa told me, referring to a procedure the church calls Contact Assist. “If you hurt yourself, the first thing I and other Scientology kids do is go quiet.” Scientology preaches that, if you touch the wound to the object that caused the injury and silently concentrate, the pain lessens and a sense of trauma fades. 

The girls demanded to be sent to boarding school, so Haggis enrolled them at the Delphian School, in rural Oregon, which uses Hubbard’s Study Tech methods. The school, Lauren says, is “on top of a hill in the middle of nowhere.” She added, “I lived in a giant bubble. Everyone I knew was a Scientologist.”

For one course, she decided to write a paper about discrimination against various religions, including Scientology. “I wanted to see what the opposition was saying, so I went online,” she says. Another student turned her in to the school’s ethics committee. Information that doesn’t correspond to Scientology teachings is termed “entheta”—meaning confused or destructive thinking. Lauren agreed to stop doing research. “It was really easy not to look,” she says. By the time she graduated from high school, at the age of twenty, she had scarcely ever heard anyone speak ill of Scientology. 

Alissa was a top student at Delphian, but she found herself moving away from the church. She still believed in some ideas promoted by Scientology, such as reincarnation, and she liked Hubbard’s educational techniques, but by the time she graduated she no longer defined herself as a Scientologist. Her reasoning was true to Hubbard’s philosophy. “A core concept in Scientology is: ‘Something isn’t true unless you find it true in your own life,’ ” she told me. 

After starting boarding school, Alissa did not speak to her father for a number of years. She was angry about the divorce. Haggis mined the experience for the script of “Million Dollar Baby,” in which the lead character, played by Clint Eastwood, is haunted by his estrangement from his daughter. 

“I’m very proud of Alissa for not talking to me,” Haggis told me, his eyes welling with tears. “Think what that takes.” It was the only time, in our many conversations, that he displayed such emotion. 

Haggis and Alissa slowly resumed communication. When Alissa was in her early twenties, she accepted the fact that, like her sister Katy, she was gay. She recalls, “When I finally got the courage to come out to my dad, he said, ‘Oh, yeah, I knew that.’ ” Now, Alissa says, she and Haggis have a “working relationship.” As she puts it, “We do see each other for Thanksgiving and some meals.” Recently, Alissa, who is also a writer, has been collaborating on screenplays with her father. Haggis also gave her the role of a murderous drug addict in “The Next Three Days.” 

In 1991, as his marriage to Gettas was crumbling, Haggis went to a Fourth of July party at the home of Scientologist friends. Deborah Rennard, who played J.R.’s alluring secretary on “Dallas,” was at the party. Rennard had grown up in a Scientology household and joined the church herself at the age of seventeen. In her early twenties, she studied acting at the Beverly Hills Playhouse and fell in love with Milton Katselas. They had recently broken up, after a six-year romance. 

“When I first met Paul, he said he was having a ‘crisis of faith,’ ” Rennard told me. “He said he’d raced up to the top of the Bridge on faith, but he hadn’t gotten what he expected.” Haggis admitted to her, “I don’t believe I’m a spiritual being. I actually am what you see.” They became a couple, and married in June, 1997, immediately after Haggis’s divorce from Gettas became final. A son, James, was born the following year. 

Rennard, concerned about her husband’s spiritual doubts, suggested that he do some more study. She was having breakthroughs that sometimes led her to discover past lives. “There were images, feelings, and thoughts that I suddenly realized, That’s not here. I’m not in my body, I’m in another place,” she told me. For instance, she might be examining what the church calls a “contra-survival” action—“like the time I clobbered Paul or threw something at him. And I’d look for an earlier similar. Suddenly, I’d realize I was doing something negative, and I’d be in England in the eighteen-hundreds. I’d see myself harming this person. It was a fleeting glimpse at what I was doing then.” Examining these moments helped the emotional charge dissipate. “Paul would say, ‘Don’t you think you’re making this up?’ ” She wondered if that mattered. “If it changed me for the better, who cares?” she says. “When you are working on a scene as an actor, something similar happens. You get connected to a feeling from who knows where.”

Haggis and Rennard shared a house in Santa Monica, which soon became a hub for progressive political fund-raisers. Haggis lent his name to nearly any cause that espoused peace and justice: the Earth Communications Office, the Hollywood Education and Literacy Project, the Center for the Advancement of Non-Violence. Despite his growing disillusionment with Scientology, he also raised a significant amount of money for it, and made sizable donations himself, appearing frequently on an honor roll of top contributors. The Church of Scientology had recently gained tax-exempt status as a religious institution, making donations, as well as the cost of auditing, tax-deductible. (Church members had lodged more than two thousand lawsuits against the Internal Revenue Service, ensnaring the agency in litigation. As part of the settlement, the church agreed to drop its legal campaign.)

Over the years, Haggis estimates, he spent more than a hundred thousand dollars on courses and auditing, and three hundred thousand dollars on various Scientology initiatives. Rennard says that she spent about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars on coursework. Haggis recalls that the demands for donations never seemed to stop. “They used friends and any kind of pressure they could apply,” he says. “I gave them money just to keep them from calling and hounding me.” 

A decade ago, Haggis moved into feature films. He co-wrote the scripts for the two most recent James Bond films, “Casino Royale” and “Quantum of Solace.” He claims that Scientology has not influenced his work—there are no evident references in his movies—but his scripts often do have an autobiographical element. “I’m not good at something unless it disturbs me,” he said. In “Million Dollar Baby,” he wrote about a boxing coach who pulls the plug on a paralyzed fighter. Haggis made a similar choice in real life with his best friend, who was brain dead from a staph infection. “They don’t die easily,” he said. “Even in a coma, he kicked and moaned for twelve hours.” Haggis likes to explore contradictions, making heroes into villains and vice versa, as with the racist cop in “Crash,” played by Matt Dillon, who molests a woman in one scene and saves her life in another. In “In the Valley of Elah,” Tommy Lee Jones plays a father trying to discover who murdered his son, a heroic soldier just returned from Iraq, only to learn that the sadism of the war had turned his son into a willing torturer.

In 2004, Haggis was rewriting “Flags of Our Fathers,” a drama about Iwo Jima, for Clint Eastwood to direct. (Haggis shared credit with William Broyles, Jr.) One day, Haggis and Eastwood visited the set of “War of the Worlds,” which Steven Spielberg was shooting with Tom Cruise. Haggis had met Cruise at a fund-raiser and, a second time, at the Celebrity Centre. Cruise says that he was introduced to the church in 1986 by his first wife, the actress Mimi Rogers. (Rogers denies this.) In 1992, he became the religion’s most famous member, telling Barbara Walters that Hubbard’s Study Tech methods had helped him overcome dyslexia. “He’s a major symbol of the church, and I think he takes that very seriously,” Haggis said. 

Tommy Davis, at Cruise’s request, was allowed to erect a tent on the set of Spielberg’s “War of the Worlds,” where Scientology materials were distributed. That raised eyebrows in Hollywood. Haggis says that when he appeared on the set Spielberg pulled him aside. “It’s really remarkable to me that I’ve met all these Scientologists, and they seem like the nicest people,” Spielberg said. Haggis replied, “Yeah, we keep all the evil ones in a closet.” (Spielberg’s publicist says that Spielberg doesn’t recall the conversation.)

A few days later, Haggis says, he was summoned to the Celebrity Centre, where officials told him that Cruise was very upset. “It was a joke,” Haggis explained. Davis offers a different account. He says that Cruise mentioned the incident to him only “in passing,” but that he himself found the remark offensive. He confronted Haggis, who apologized profusely, asking that his contrition be relayed to “anyone who might have been offended.”

Davis has known Cruise since Davis was eighteen years old. They are close friends. The two men physically resemble each other, with long faces, strong jaws, and spiky haircuts. “I saw him hanging out with Tom Cruise after the Oscars,” Haggis recalls. “At the Vanity Fair party, they were let in the back door. They arrived on motorcycles, really cool ones, like Ducatis.” Cruise was also close to David Miscavige, and has said of him, “I have never met a more competent, a more intelligent, a more tolerant, a more compassionate being outside of what I have experienced from L.R.H. And I’ve met the leaders of leaders.” 

In 2004, Cruise received a special Scientology award: the Freedom Medal of Valor. In a ceremony held in England, Miscavige called Cruise “the most dedicated Scientologist I know.” The ceremony was accompanied by a video interview with the star. Wearing a black turtleneck, and with the theme music from “Mission: Impossible” playing in the background, Cruise said, “Being a Scientologist, you look at someone and you know absolutely that you can help them. So, for me, it really is K.S.W.”—initials that stand for “Keeping Scientology Working.” He went on, “That policy to me has really gone—phist!” He made a vigorous gesture with his hand. “Boy! There’s a time I went through and I said, ‘You know what? When I read it, you know, I just went poo! This is it!’ ” Later, when the video was posted on YouTube and viewed by millions who had no idea what he was talking about, Cruise came across as unhinged. He did not dispel this notion when, in 2005, during an interview with Oprah Winfrey, he jumped up and down on a couch while declaring his love for the actress Katie Holmes. He and Holmes married in 2006, in Italy. David Miscavige was his best man.

Proposition 8, the California initiative against gay marriage, passed in November, 2008. Haggis learned from his daughter Lauren of the San Diego chapter’s endorsement of it. He immediately sent Davis several e-mails, demanding that the church take a public stand opposing the ban on gay marriage. “I am going to an anti Prop 8 rally in a couple of hours,” he wrote on November 11th, after the election. “When can we expect the public statement?” In a response, Davis proposed sending a letter to the San Diego press, saying that the church had been “erroneously listed among the supporters of Proposition 8.”

“ ‘Erroneous’ doesn’t cut it,” Haggis responded. In another note, he remarked, “The church may have had the luxury of not taking a position on this issue before, but after taking a position, even erroneously, it can no longer stand neutral.” He demanded that the church openly declare that it supports gay rights. “Anything less won’t do.” 

Davis explained to Haggis that the church avoids taking overt political stands. He also felt that Haggis was exaggerating the impact of the San Diego endorsement. “It was one guy who somehow got it in his head it would be a neat idea and put Church of Scientology San Diego on the list,” Davis told me. “When I found out, I had it removed from the list.” Davis said that the individual who made the mistake—he didn’t divulge the name—had been “disciplined” for it. I asked what that meant. “He was sat down by a staff member of the local organization,” Davis explained. “He got sorted out.”

Davis told me that Haggis was mistaken about his daughter having been ostracized by Scientologists. Davis said that he had spoken to the friend who had allegedly abandoned Katy, and the friend had ended the relationship not because Katy was a lesbian but because Katy had lied about it. (Haggis, when informed of this account, laughed.)

As far as Davis was concerned, reprimanding the San Diego staff member was the end of the matter: “I said, ‘Paul, I’ve received no press inquiries. . . . If I were to make a statement on this, it would actually be more attention to the subject than if we leave it be.’ ”

Haggis refused to let the matter drop. “This is not a P.R. issue, it is a moral issue,” he wrote, in February, 2009. In the final note of this exchange, he conceded, “You were right: nothing happened—it didn’t flap—at least not very much. But I feel we shamed ourselves.”

Haggis sent this note six months before he resigned. Because he stopped complaining, Davis felt that the issue had been laid to rest. But, far from putting the matter behind him, Haggis began his investigation into the church. His inquiry, much of it conducted online, mirrored the actions of the lead character he was writing for “The Next Three Days”; the character, played by Russell Crowe, goes on the Internet to find a way to break his wife out of jail. 

Haggis soon found on YouTube the video of Tommy Davis talking on CNN about disconnection. The practice of disconnection is not unique to Scientology. The Amish, for example, cut themselves off from apostates, including their own children; some Orthodox Jewish communities do the same. Rennard had disconnected from her parents twice. When she was a young child, her stepfather had got the family involved with Scientology. When she was in her twenties, and appearing on “Dallas,” her parents broke away from the church. Like many active members of Scientology, they had kept money in an account (in their case, twenty-five hundred dollars) for future courses they intended to take. Rennard’s mother took the money back. “That’s a huge deal for the church,” Rennard told me. She didn’t speak to her parents for several years, assuming that they had been declared Suppressive Persons. 

In the early nineties, Rennard wrote to the International Justice Chief, the Scientology official in charge of such matters; she was informed that she could talk to her parents again. A decade later, however, she went to Clearwater, intending to take some upper-level courses, and was told that the previous ruling no longer applied. If she wanted to do more training, she had to confront her parents’ mistakes. The church recommended that she take a course called P.T.S./S.P., which stands for “Potential Trouble Source/Suppressive Persons.” “That course took a year,” Rennard told me. She petitioned officials at the Celebrity Centre in Los Angeles for help. “They put me on a program that took two years to complete,” she says. Still, nothing changed. If she failed to “handle” her parents, she would have to disconnect not only from them but also from everyone who spoke to them, including her siblings. “It was that, or else I had to give up being a Scientologist,” she says. 

Rennard’s parents were among four hundred claimants in a lawsuit brought against Scientology by disaffected members in 1987; the case was thrown out of court the following year, for lack of evidence. To make amends, Rennard’s parents had to denounce the anti-Scientologist group and offer a “token” restitution. The church prescribes a seven-step course of rehabilitation, called A to E, for penitents seeking to get back into its good graces, which includes returning debts and making public declarations of error. Rennard told her parents that if they wanted to remain in contact with her they had to follow the church’s procedures. Her parents, worried that they would also be cut off from their grandson, agreed to perform community service. “They really wanted to work it out with me,” she says. 

But the church wasn’t satisfied. Rennard was told that if she maintained contact with her parents she would be labelled a “Potential Trouble Source”—a designation that would alienate her from the Scientology community and render her ineligible for further training. “It was clearly laid out for me,” she says. A senior official counselled her to agree to have her parents formally branded as S.P.s. “Until then, they won’t turn around and recognize their responsibilities,” he said. “O.K., fine,” Rennard said. “Go ahead and declare them. Maybe it’ll get better.” She was granted permission to begin upper-level coursework in Clearwater.

In August, 2006, a notice was posted at the Celebrity Centre declaring Rennard’s parents Suppressive Persons, saying that they had associated with “squirrels,” which in Scientology refers to people who have dropped out of the church but continue to practice unauthorized auditing. A month later, Rennard’s parents sent her a letter: “We tried to do what you asked, Deborah. We worked the whole months of July & Aug. on A-E.” They explained that they had paid the church the twenty-five hundred dollars. After all that, they continued, a church adjudicator had told them to hand out three hundred copies of L. Ron Hubbard’s pamphlet “The Way to Happiness” to libraries; they had also been told to document the exchange with photographs. They had declined. “If this can’t be resolved, we will have to say Good-Bye to you & James will lose his Grand-Parents,” her mother wrote. “This is ridiculous.”

In April, 2007, Rennard’s parents sued for the right to visit their grandson. Rennard had to hire an attorney. Eventually, the church relented. She was summoned to a church mission in Santa Monica and shown a statement rescinding the ruling that her parents were S.P.s. 

Tommy Davis sent me some policy statements that Hubbard had made about disconnection in 1965. “Anyone who rejects Scientology also rejects, knowingly or unknowingly, the protection and benefits of Scientology and the companionship of Scientologists,” Hubbard writes. In “Introduction to Scientology Ethics,” Hubbard defined disconnection as “a self-determined decision made by an individual that he is not going to be connected to another.” 

Scientology defectors are full of tales of forcible family separations, which the church almost uniformly denies. Two former leaders in the church, Marty Rathbun and Mike Rinder, told me that families are sometimes broken apart. In their cases, their wives chose to stay in the church when they left. The wives, and the church, denounce Rathbun and Rinder as liars. 

A few days after sending the resignation letter to Tommy Davis, Haggis came home from work to find nine or ten of his Scientology friends standing in his front yard. He invited them in to talk. Anne Archer was there with Terry Jastrow, her husband, an actor turned producer and director. “Paul had been such an ally,” Archer told me. “It was pretty painful. Everyone wanted to see if there could be some kind of resolution.” Mark Isham, an Emmy-winning composer who has scored films for Haggis, came with his wife, Donna. Sky Dayton, the EarthLink founder, was there, along with several other friends and a church representative Haggis didn’t know. His friends could have served as an advertisement for Scientology—they were wealthy high achievers with solid marriages, who embraced the idea that the church had given them a sense of well-being and the skills to excel. 

Scientologists are trained to believe in their persuasive powers and the need to keep a positive frame of mind. But the mood in the room was downbeat and his friends’ questions were full of reproach. 

Jastrow asked Haggis, “Do you have any idea that what you might do might damage a lot of pretty wonderful people and your fellow-Scientologists?” 

Haggis reminded the group that he had been with them at the 1985 “freedom march” in Portland. They all knew about his financial support of the church and the occasions when he had spoken out in its defense. Jastrow remembers Haggis saying, “I love Scientology.”

Archer had particular reason to feel aggrieved: Haggis’s letter had called her son a liar. “Paul was very sweet,” she says. “We didn’t talk about Tommy.” She understood that Haggis was upset about the way Proposition 8 had affected his gay daughters, but she didn’t think it was relevant to Scientology. “The church is not political,” she told me. “We all have tons of friends and relatives who are gay. . . . It’s not the church’s issue. I’ve introduced gay friends to Scientology.”

Isham was frustrated. “We weren’t breaking through to him,” he told me. Of all the friends present, Isham was the closest to Haggis. “We share a common artistic sensibility,” Isham said. When he visited Abbey Road Studios, in England, to record the score that he had written for “In the Valley of Elah,” Haggis went along with him. Haggis wanted him to compose the score for “The Next Three Days.” Now their friendship was at risk. Isham used Scientology to analyze the situation. In his view, Haggis’s emotions at that moment ranked 1.1 on the Tone Scale—the state that is sometimes called Covertly Hostile. By adopting a tone just above it—Anger—Isham hoped to blast Haggis out of the psychic place where he seemed to be lodged. “This was an intellectual decision,” Isham said. “I decided I would be angry.”

“Paul, I’m pissed off,” Isham told Haggis. “There’s better ways to do this. If you have a complaint, there’s a complaint line.” Anyone who genuinely wanted to change Scientology should stay within the organization, Isham argued, not quit; certainly, going public was not helpful. 

Haggis listened patiently. A fundamental tenet of Scientology is that differing points of view must be fully heard and acknowledged. When his friends finished, however, Haggis had his own set of grievances. 

He referred them to the exposé in the St. Petersburg Times that had so shaken him: “The Truth Rundown.” The first installment had appeared in June, 2009. Haggis had learned from reading it that several of the church’s top managers had defected in despair. Marty Rathbun had once been inspector general of the church’s Religious Technology Center, which holds the trademarks of Scientology and Dianetics, and exists to “protect the public from misapplication of the technology.” Rathbun had also overseen Scientology’s legal-defense strategy, and reported directly to Miscavige. Amy Scobee had been an executive in the Celebrity Centre network. Mike Rinder had been the church’s spokesperson, the job now held by Tommy Davis. One by one, they had disappeared from Scientology, and it had never occurred to Haggis to ask where they had gone. 

The defectors told the newspaper that Miscavige was a serial abuser of his staff. “The issue wasn’t the physical pain of it,” Rinder said. “It’s the fact that the domination you’re getting—hit in the face, kicked—and you can’t do anything about it. If you did try, you’d be attacking the C.O.B.”—the chairman of the board. Tom De Vocht, a defector who had been a manager at the Clearwater spiritual center, told the paper that he, too, had been beaten by Miscavige; he said that from 2003 to 2005 he had witnessed Miscavige striking other staff members as many as a hundred times. Rathbun, Rinder, and De Vocht all admitted that they had engaged in physical violence themselves. “It had become the accepted way of doing things,” Rinder said. Amy Scobee said that nobody challenged the abuse because people were terrified of Miscavige. Their greatest fear was expulsion: “You don’t have any money. You don’t have job experience. You don’t have anything. And he could put you on the streets and ruin you.”

Assessing the truthfulness of such inflammatory statements—made by people who deserted the church or were expelled—was a challenge for the newspaper, which has maintained a special focus on Scientology. (Clearwater is twenty miles northwest of downtown St. Petersburg.) In 1998, six years before he defected, Rathbun told the paper that he had never seen Miscavige hit anyone. Now he said, “That was the biggest lie I ever told you.” The reporters behind “The Truth Rundown,” Joe Childs and Thomas Tobin, interviewed each defector separately and videotaped many of the sessions. “It added a measure of confidence,” Childs told me. “Their stories just tracked.” 

Much of the alleged abuse took place at the Gold Base, a Scientology outpost in the desert near Hemet, a town eighty miles southeast of Los Angeles. Miscavige has an office there, and the site features, among other things, movie studios and production facilities for the church’s many publications. For decades, the base’s location was unknown even to many church insiders. Haggis visited the Gold Base only once, in the early eighties, when he was about to direct his Scientology commercial. The landscape, he said, suggested a spa, “beautiful and restful,” but he found the atmosphere sterile and scary. Surrounded by a security fence, the base houses about eight hundred Sea Org members, in quarters that the church likens to those “in a convent or seminary, albeit much more comfortable.” 

According to a court declaration filed by Rathbun in July, Miscavige expected Scientology leaders to instill aggressive, even violent, discipline. Rathbun said that he was resistant, and that Miscavige grew frustrated with him, assigning him in 2004 to the Hole—a pair of double-wide trailers at the Gold Base. “There were between eighty and a hundred people sentenced to the Hole at that time,” Rathbun said, in the declaration. “We were required to do group confessions all day and all night.” 

The church claims that such stories are false: “There is not, and never has been, any place of ‘confinement’ . . . nor is there anything in Church policy that would allow such confinement.”

According to Rathbun, Miscavige came to the Hole one evening and announced that everyone was going to play musical chairs. Only the last person standing would be allowed to stay on the base. He declared that people whose spouses “were not participants would have their marriages terminated.” The St. Petersburg Times noted that Miscavige played Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” on a boom box as the church leaders fought over the chairs, punching each other and, in one case, ripping a chair apart.

Tom De Vocht, one of the participants, says that the event lasted until four in the morning: “It got more and more physical as the number of chairs went down.” Many of the participants had long been cut off from their families. They had no money, no credit cards, no telephones. According to De Vocht, many lacked a driver’s license or a passport. Few had any savings or employment prospects. As people fell out of the game, Miscavige had airplane reservations made for them. He said that buses were going to be leaving at six in the morning. The powerlessness of everyone else in the room was nakedly clear. 

Tommy Davis told me that a musical-chairs episode did occur. He explained that Miscavige had been away from the Gold Base for some time, and when he returned he discovered that in his absence many jobs had been reassigned. The game was meant to demonstrate that even seemingly small changes can be disruptive to an organization—underscoring an “administrative policy of the church.” The rest of the defectors’ accounts, Davis told me, was “hoo-ha”: “Chairs being ripped apart, and people being threatened that they’re going to be sent to far-flung places in the world, plane tickets being purchased, and they’re going to force their spouses—and on and on and on. I mean, it’s just nuts!”

Jefferson Hawkins, a former Sea Org member and church executive who worked with Haggis on the rejected Dianetics ad campaign, told me that Miscavige had struck or beaten him on five occasions, the first time in 2002. “I had just written an infomercial,” he said. Miscavige summoned him to a meeting where a few dozen members were seated on one side of a table; Miscavige sat by himself on the other side. According to Hawkins, Miscavige began a tirade about the ad’s shortcomings. Hawkins recalls, “Without any warning, he jumped up onto the conference-room table and he launches himself at me. He knocks me back against a cubicle wall and starts battering my face.” The two men fell to the floor, Hawkins says, and their legs became entangled. “Let go of my legs!” Miscavige shouted. According to Hawkins, Miscavige then “stomped out of the room,” leaving Hawkins on the floor, shocked and bruised. The others did nothing to support him, he claims: “They were saying, ‘Get up! Get up!’ ”

I asked Hawkins why he hadn’t called the police. He reminded me that church members believe that Scientology holds the key to salvation: “Only by going through Scientology will you reach spiritual immortality. You can go from life to life to life without being cognizant of what is going on. If you don’t go through Scientology, you’re condemned to dying over and over again in ignorance and darkness, never knowing your true nature as a spirit. Nobody who is a believer wants to lose that.” Miscavige, Hawkins says, “holds the power of eternal life and death over you.”

Moreover, Scientologists are taught to handle internal conflicts within the church’s own justice system. Hawkins told me that if a Sea Org member sought outside help he would be punished, either by being declared a Suppressive Person or by being sent off to do manual labor, as Hawkins was made to do after Miscavige beat him. The church denies that Hawkins was mistreated, and notes that he has participated in protests organized by Anonymous, a “hacktivist” collective that has targeted Scientology. The group pugnaciously opposes censorship, and became hostile toward Scientology after the church invoked copyright claims in order to remove from the Internet the video of Tom Cruise extolling “K.S.W.” The church describes Anonymous as a “cyber-terrorist group”; last month, the F.B.I. raided the homes of three dozen members after Anonymous attacked the Web sites of corporations critical of WikiLeaks. (Two members of Anonymous have pleaded guilty to participating in a 2008 attack on a Scientology Web site.) 

The church provided me with eleven statements from Scientologists, all of whom said that Miscavige had never been violent. One of them, Yael Lustgarten, said that she was present at the meeting with Hawkins and that the attack by Miscavige never happened. She claims that Hawkins made a mess of his presentation—“He smelled of body odor, he was unshaven, his voice tone was very low, and he could hardly be heard”—and was admonished to shape up. She says that Hawkins “wasn’t hit by anyone.” The defector Amy Scobee, however, says that she witnessed the attack—the two men had fallen into her cubicle. After the altercation, she says, “I gathered all the buttons from Jeff’s shirt and the change from his pockets and gave them back to him.”

The church characterizes Scobee, Rinder, Rathbun, Hawkins, De Vocht, Hines, and other defectors I spoke with as “discredited individuals,” who were demoted for incompetence or expelled for corruption; the defectors’ accounts are consistent only because they have “banded together to advance and support each other’s false ‘stories.’ ” 

After reading the St. Petersburg Times series, Haggis tracked down Marty Rathbun, who was living on Corpus Christi Bay, in south Texas. Rathbun had been making ends meet by writing freelance articles for local newspapers and selling beer at a ballpark. 

Haggis complained that Davis hadn’t been honest with him about Scientology’s policies. “I said, ‘That’s not Tommy, he has no say,’ ” Rathbun told me. “Miscavige is a total micromanager. I explained the whole culture.” He says that Haggis was shocked by the conversation. “The thing that was most troubling to Paul was that I literally had to escape,” Rathbun told me. (A few nights after the musical-chairs incident, he got on his motorcycle and waited until a gate was opened for someone else; he sped out and didn’t stop for thirty miles.) Haggis called several other former Scientologists he knew well. One of them said that he had escaped from the Gold Base by driving his car—an Alfa Romeo convertible that Haggis had sold him—through a wooden fence. The defector said that he had scars on his forehead from the incident. Still others had been expelled or declared Suppressive Persons. Haggis asked himself, “What kind of organization are we involved in where people just disappear?” 

When Haggis began casting for “The Next Three Days,” in the summer of 2009, he asked Jason Beghe to read for the part of a cop. Beghe was a gravel-voiced character actor who had played Demi Moore’s love interest in “G.I. Jane.” In the late nineties, Haggis had worked with Beghe on a CBS series, “Family Law.” Like so many others, Beghe had come to the church through the Beverly Hills Playhouse. In old promotional materials for the church, he is quoted as saying that Scientology is “a rocket ride to spiritual freedom.” 

Beghe told Haggis, “You should know that I’m no longer in Scientology. Actually, I’m one of its most outspoken critics. The church would be very unhappy if you hire me.” 

Haggis responded, “Nobody tells me who I cast.” He looked at a lengthy video that Beghe had posted on the Internet, in which he denounces the church as “destructive and a ripoff.” Haggis thought that Beghe had “gone over the edge.” But he asked if they could talk. 

The two men met at Patrick’s Roadhouse, a coffee shop on the beach in Pacific Palisades. Beghe was calmer than he had been in the video, which he called “a snapshot of me having been out only three months.” Even though Beghe had renounced the church, he continued to use Scientology methods when dealing with members and former members. “It’s almost like: ‘I can speak Chinese, I understand the culture,’ ” he explained to me. In several meetings with Haggis, he employed techniques based on what Hubbard labelled “Ethics Conditions.” These range from Confusion at the bottom and ascend through Treason, Enemy, Doubt, Liability, and Emergency, eventually leading to Power. “Each one of the conditions has a specific set of steps in a formula, and, once that formula is applied correctly, you will move up to the next-highest condition,” Beghe explained. “I assumed that Paul was in a condition of Doubt.” 

Beghe joined Scientology in 1994. He told Haggis that, in the late nineties, he began having emotional problems, and the church recommended auditing and coursework. In retrospect, he felt that it had done no good. “I was paying money for them to fuck me up,” he said. “I spent about five or six hundred thousand dollars trying to get better, and I continued to get worse.” He says that when he finally decided to leave the church, in 2007, he told an official that the church was in a condition of Liability to him. Ordinarily, when a Scientologist does something wrong, especially something that might damage the image of the organization, he has to make amends, often in the form of a substantial contribution. But now the situation was reversed. Beghe recalls telling the official, “You guys don’t have any policies to make up the damage.” He eventually suggested to the official that the church buy property and lease it to him at a negligible rate; the church now characterizes this as an attempt at extortion. 

Beghe was reluctant to use the word “brainwashing”—“whatever the fuck that is”—but he did feel that his mind had been somehow taken over. “You have all these thoughts, all these ways of looking at things, that are L. Ron Hubbard’s,” he explained. “You think you’re becoming more you, but within that is an implanted thing, which is You the Scientologist.”

Perhaps because Haggis had never been as much of a true believer as some members, he didn’t feel as deeply betrayed as Beghe did. “I didn’t feel that some worm had buried itself in my ear, and if you plucked it out you would find L. Ron Hubbard and his thought,” he told me. But, as he continued his investigation, he became increasingly disturbed. He read the church’s official rebuttal to the St. Petersburg Times series, in the Scientology magazine Freedom. It included an annotated transcript of conversations that had taken place between the reporters and representatives of the church, including Tommy Davis and his wife, Jessica Feshbach. In Freedom’s rendition of those conversations, the reporters’ sources were not named, perhaps to shield Scientologists from the shock of seeing familiar names publicly denouncing the organization. Rathbun was called “Kingpin” and Scobee “the Adulteress.” 

At one point in the transcribed conversations, Davis reminded the reporters that Scobee had been expelled from the church leadership because of an affair. The reporters responded that she had denied having sexual contact outside her marriage. “That’s a lie,” Davis told them. Feshbach, who had a stack of documents, elaborated: “She has a written admission [of] each one of her instances of extramarital indiscretion. . . . I believe there were five.” When Haggis read this in Freedom, he presumed that the church had obtained its information from the declarations that members sometimes provide after auditing. Such confessions are supposed to be confidential. (Scientology denies that it obtained the information this way, and Davis produced an affidavit, signed by Scobee, in which she admits to having liaisons. Scobee denies committing adultery, and says that she did not write the affidavit; she says that she signed it in the hope of leaving the church on good terms, so that she could stay in touch with relatives.)

In his letter to Davis, Haggis said that he was worried that the church might look through his files to smear him, too. “Luckily, I have never held myself up to be anyone’s role model,” he wrote. 

At his house, Haggis finished telling his friends what he had learned. He suggested that they should at least examine the evidence. “I directed them to certain Web sites,” he said, mentioning Exscientologykids.com, which was created by three young women who grew up in Scientology and subsequently left. Many stories on the site are from men and women who joined the Sea Org before turning eighteen. One of them was Jenna Miscavige Hill, David Miscavige’s niece, who joined when she was twelve. For Hill and many others, formal education had stopped when they entered the Sea Org, leaving them especially ill-prepared, they say, for coping with life outside the church. 

The stories Haggis found on the Internet of children drafted into the Sea Org appalled him. “They were ten years old, twelve years old, signing billion-year contracts—and their parents go along with this?” Haggis told me. “Scrubbing pots, manual labor—that so deeply touched me. My God, it horrified me!” The stories of the Sea Org children reminded Haggis of child slaves he had seen in Haiti. 

Many Sea Org volunteers find themselves with no viable options for adulthood. If they try to leave, the church presents them with a “freeloader tab” for all the coursework and counselling they have received; the bill can amount to more than a hundred thousand dollars. Payment is required in order to leave in good standing. “Many of them actually pay it,” Haggis said. “They leave, they’re ashamed of what they’ve done, they’ve got no money, no job history, they’re lost, they just disappear.” In what seemed like a very unguarded comment, he said, “I would gladly take down the church for that one thing.”

The church says that it adheres to “all child labor laws,” and that minors can’t sign up without parental consent; the freeloader tabs are an “ecclesiastical matter” and are not enforced through litigation. 

Haggis’s friends came away from the meeting with mixed feelings. “We all left no clearer than when we went in,” Archer said. Isham felt that there was still a possibility of getting Haggis “to behave himself.” He said that Haggis had agreed that “it wasn’t helping anyone” to continue distributing the letter, and had promised not to circulate it further. Unmentioned was the fact that this would be the last time most of them ever spoke to Haggis.

I asked Isham if he had taken Haggis’s advice and looked at the Web sites or the articles in the St. Petersburg Times. “I started to,” he said. “But it was like reading ‘Mein Kampf’ if you wanted to know something about the Jewish religion.”

In the days after the friends visited Haggis’s home, church officials and members came to his office, distracting his colleagues, particularly his producing partner, Michael Nozik, who is not a Scientologist. “Every day, for hours, he would have conversations with them,” Nozik told me. It was August, 2009, and shooting for “The Next Three Days” was set to start in Pittsburgh at the end of the month; the office desperately needed Haggis’s attention. “But he felt a need to go through the process fully,” Nozik says. “He wanted to give them a full hearing.” 

“I listened to their point of view, but I didn’t change my mind,” Haggis says, noting that the Scientology officials “became more livid and irrational.” He added, “I applied more Scientology in those meetings than they did.” 

Davis and other church officials told Haggis that Miscavige had not beaten his employees; his accusers, they said, had committed the violence. Supposing that was true, Haggis said, why hadn’t Miscavige stopped it? Haggis recalls that, at one meeting, he told Davis and five other officials, “If someone in my organization is beating people, I would sure know about it. You think I would put up with it? And I’m not that good a person.” Haggis noted that, if the rumors of Miscavige’s violent temper were true, it proved that everyone is fallible. “Look at Martin Luther King, Jr.,” he said, alluding to King’s sexual improprieties. 

“How dare you compare Dave Miscavige with Martin Luther King!” one of the officials shouted. Haggis was shocked. “They thought that comparing Miscavige to Martin Luther King was debasing his character,” he says. “If they were trying to convince me that Scientology was not a cult, they did a very poor job of it.” (Davis says that King’s name never came up.)

In October, 2009, Marty Rathbun called Haggis and asked if he could publish the resignation letter on his blog. Rathbun had become an informal spokesperson for defectors who believed that the church had broken away from Hubbard’s original teachings. Haggis was in Pittsburgh, shooting his picture. “You’re a journalist, you don’t need my permission,” Haggis said, although he asked Rathbun to excise parts related to Katy’s homosexuality. 

Haggis says that he didn’t think about the consequences of his decision: “I thought it would show up on a couple of Web sites. I’m a writer, I’m not Lindsay Lohan.” Rathbun got fifty-five thousand hits on his blog that afternoon. The next morning, the story was in newspapers around the world. 

At the time Haggis was doing his research, the F.B.I. was conducting its own investigation. In December, 2009, Tricia Whitehill, a special agent from the Los Angeles office, flew to Florida to interview former members of the church in the F.B.I.’s office in downtown Clearwater, which happens to be directly across the street from Scientology’s spiritual headquarters. Tom De Vocht, who spoke with Whitehill, told me, “I understood that the investigation had been going on for quite a while.” He says Whitehill confided that she hadn’t told the local agents what the investigation was about, in case the office had been infiltrated. Amy Scobee spoke to the F.B.I. for two days. “They wanted a full download about the abuse,” she told me. 

Whitehill and Valerie Venegas, the lead agent on the case, also interviewed former Sea Org members in California. One of them was Gary Morehead, who had been the head of security at the Gold Base; he left the church in 1996. In February, 2010, he spoke to Whitehill and told her that he had developed a “blow drill” to track down Sea Org members who left Gold Base. “We got wickedly good at it,” he says. In thirteen years, he estimates, he and his security team brought more than a hundred Sea Org members back to the base. When emotional, spiritual, or psychological pressure failed to work, Morehead says, physical force was sometimes used to bring escapees back. (The church says that blow drills do not exist.) 

Whitehill and Venegas worked on a special task force devoted to human trafficking. The laws regarding trafficking were built largely around forced prostitution, but they also pertain to slave labor. Under federal law, slavery is defined, in part, by the use of coercion, torture, starvation, imprisonment, threats, and psychological abuse. The California penal code lists several indicators that someone may be a victim of human trafficking: signs of trauma or fatigue; being afraid or unable to talk, because of censorship by others or security measures that prevent communication with others; working in one place without the freedom to move about; owing a debt to one’s employer; and not having control over identification documents. Those conditions echo the testimony of many former Sea Org members who lived at the Gold Base. 

Sea Org members who have “failed to fulfill their ecclesiastical responsibilities” may be sent to one of the church’s several Rehabilitation Project Force locations. Defectors describe them as punitive reëducation camps. In California, there is one in Los Angeles; until 2005, there was one near the Gold Base, at a place called Happy Valley. Bruce Hines, the defector turned research physicist, says that he was confined to R.P.F. for six years, first in L.A., then in Happy Valley. He recalls that the properties were heavily guarded and that anyone who tried to flee would be tracked down and subjected to further punishment. “In 1995, when I was put in R.P.F., there were twelve of us,” Hines said. “At the high point, in 2000, there were about a hundred and twenty of us.” Some members have been in R.P.F. for more than a decade, doing manual labor and extensive spiritual work. (Davis says that Sea Org members enter R.P.F. by their own choosing and can leave at any time; the manual labor maintains church facilities and instills “pride of accomplishment.”)

In 2009, two former Sea Org members, Claire and Marc Headley, filed lawsuits against the church. They had both joined as children. Claire became a member of the Sea Org at the age of sixteen, and was assigned to the Gold Base. She says she wasn’t allowed to tell anyone where she was going, not even her mother, who was made to sign over guardianship. (Claire’s mother, who is still in the church, has issued a sworn statement denying that she lost contact with her daughter.) The security apparatus at the Gold Base intimidated Claire. “Even though I had been in Scientology pretty much all my life, this was a whole new world,” she told me. She says she was rarely allowed even a telephone call to her mother. “Every last trace of my life, as I knew it, was thrown away,” she said. “It was like living in George Orwell’s ‘1984.’ ”

Claire met Marc Headley, also a teen-ager, soon after her arrival. “We had no ties to anyone not in Scientology,” Claire said. “It was a very closeted and controlled existence.” Marc says it was widely known around the base that he was one of the first people Tom Cruise audited. In Scientology, the auditor bears a significant responsibility for the progress of his subject. “If you audit somebody and that person leaves the organization, there’s only one person whose fault that is—the auditor,” Headley told me. (Cruise’s attorney says that Cruise doesn’t recall meeting Marc.) Claire and Marc fell in love, and married in 1992. She says that she was pressured by the church to have two abortions, because of a stipulation that Sea Org members can’t have children. The church denies that it pressures members to terminate pregnancies. Lucy James, a former Scientologist who had access to Sea Org personnel records, says that she knows of dozens of cases in which members were pressed to have abortions.

In 2005, Marc Headley says, he was punched by Miscavige during an argument. He and his wife quit. (The church calls Marc Headley dishonest, claiming that he kept seven hundred dollars in profits after being authorized to sell Scientology camera equipment; Headley says that shipping costs and other expenses account for the discrepancy.) In 2009, the Headleys filed their suits, which maintained that the working conditions at the Gold Base violated labor and human-trafficking laws. The church responded that the Headleys were ministers who had voluntarily submitted to the rigors of their calling, and that the First Amendment protected Scientology’s religious practices. The court agreed with this argument and dismissed the Headleys’ complaints, awarding the church forty thousand dollars in litigation costs. The court also indicated that the Headleys were technically free to leave the Gold Base. The Headleys have appealed the rulings.

Defectors also talked to the F.B.I. about Miscavige’s luxurious life style. The law prohibits the head of a tax-exempt organization from enjoying unusual perks or compensation; it’s called inurement. Tommy Davis refused to disclose how much money Miscavige earns, and the church isn’t required to do so, but Headley and other defectors suggest that Miscavige lives more like a Hollywood star than like the head of a religious organization—flying on chartered jets and wearing shoes custom-made in London. Claire Headley says that, when she was in Scientology, Miscavige had five stewards and two chefs at his disposal; he also had a large car collection, including a Saleen Mustang, similar to one owned by Cruise, and six motorcycles. (The church denies this characterization and “vigorously objects to the suggestion that Church funds inure to the private benefit of Mr. Miscavige.”)

Former Sea Org members report that Miscavige receives elaborate birthday and Christmas gifts from Scientology groups around the world. One year, he was given a Vyrus 985 C3 4V, a motorcycle with a retail price of seventy thousand dollars. “These gifts are tokens of love and respect for Mr. Miscavige,” Davis informed me. 

By contrast, Sea Org members typically receive fifty dollars a week. Often, this stipend is docked for small infractions, such as failing to meet production quotas or skipping scripture-study sessions. According to Janela Webster, who was in the Sea Org for nineteen years before defecting, in 2006, it wasn’t unusual for a member to be paid as little as thirteen dollars a week.

I recently spoke with two sources in the F.B.I. who are close to the investigation. They assured me that the case remains open. 

Last April, John Brousseau, who had been in the Sea Org for more than thirty years, left the Gold Base. He was unhappy with Miscavige, his former brother-in-law, whom he considered “detrimental to the goals of Scientology.” He drove across the country, to south Texas, to meet Marty Rathbun. “I was there a couple of nights,” he says. At five-thirty one morning, he was leaving the motel room where he was staying, to get coffee, when he heard footsteps behind him. It was Tommy Davis; he and nineteen church members had tracked Brousseau down. Brousseau locked himself in his room and called Rathbun, who alerted the police; Davis went home without Brousseau. 

In a deposition given in July, Davis said no when asked if he had ever “followed a Sea Organization member that has blown”—fled the church. Under further questioning, he admitted that he and an entourage had flown to Texas in a jet chartered by Scientology, and had shown up outside Brousseau’s motel room at dawn. But he insisted that he was only trying “to see a friend of mine.” Davis now calls Brousseau “a liar.”

Brousseau says that his defection caused anxiety, in part because he had worked on a series of special projects for Tom Cruise. Brousseau maintained grounds and buildings at the Gold Base. He worked for fourteen months on the renovation of the Freewinds, the only ship left in Scientology’s fleet; he also says that he installed bars over the doors of the Hole, at the Gold Base, shortly after Rathbun escaped. (The church denies this.) 

In 2005, Miscavige showed Cruise a Harley-Davidson motorcycle he owned. At Miscavige’s request, Brousseau had had the vehicle’s parts plated with brushed nickel and painted candy-apple red. Brousseau recalls, “Cruise asked me, ‘God, could you paint my bike like that?’ I looked at Miscavige, and Miscavige agreed.” Cruise brought in two motorcycles to be painted, a Triumph and a Honda Rune; the Honda had been given to him by Spielberg after the filming of “War of the Worlds.” “The Honda already had a custom paint job by the set designer,” Brousseau recalls. Each motorcycle had to be taken apart completely, and all the parts nickel-plated, before it was painted. (The church denies Brousseau’s account.)

Brousseau also says that he helped customize a Ford Excursion S.U.V. that Cruise owned, installing features such as handmade eucalyptus panelling. The customization job was presented to Tom Cruise as a gift from David Miscavige, he said. “I was getting paid fifty dollars a week,” he recalls. “And I’m supposed to be working for the betterment of mankind.” Several years ago, Brousseau says, he worked on the renovation of an airport hangar that Cruise maintains in Burbank. Sea Org members installed faux scaffolding, giant banners bearing the emblems of aircraft manufacturers, and a luxurious office that was fabricated at church facilities, then reassembled inside the hangar. Brousseau showed me dozens of photographs documenting his work for Cruise. 

Both Cruise’s attorney and the church deny Brousseau’s account. Cruise’s attorney says that “the Church of Scientology has never expended any funds to the personal benefit of Mr. Cruise or provided him with free services.” Tommy Davis says that these projects were done by contractors, and that Brousseau acted merely as an adviser. He also says, “None of the Church staff involved were coerced in any way to assist Mr. Cruise. Church staff, and indeed Church members, hold Mr. Cruise in very high regard and are honored to assist him. Whatever small economic benefit Mr. Cruise may have received from the assistance of Church staff pales in comparison to the benefits the Church has received from Mr. Cruise’s many years of volunteer efforts for the Church.” Yet this assistance may have involved many hours of unpaid labor on the part of Sea Org members.

Miscavige’s official title is chairman of the board of the Religious Technology Center, but he dominates the entire organization. His word is absolute, and he imposes his will even on some of the people closest to him. According to Rinder and Brousseau, in June, 2006, while Miscavige was away from the Gold Base, his wife, Shelly, filled several job vacancies without her husband’s permission. Soon afterward, she disappeared. Her current status is unknown. Tommy Davis told me, “I definitely know where she is,” but he won’t disclose where that is.

The garden behind Anne Archer and Terry Jastrow’s house, in Brentwood, is filled with olive trees and hummingbirds. A fountain gurgles beside the swimming pool. When I visited, last May, Jastrow told me about the first time he met Archer, in Milton Katselas’s class. “I saw this girl sitting next to Milton,” Jastrow recalled. “I said, ‘Who is that?’ ” There was a cool wind blowing in from the Pacific, and Archer drew a shawl around her. 

“We were friends for about a year and a half before we ever had our first date,” Archer said. They were married in 1978. “Our relationship really works,” Jastrow said. “We attribute that essentially a hundred per cent to applying Scientology.” The two spoke of the techniques that had helped them, such as never being critical of the other and never interrupting. 

“This isn’t a creed,” Archer said. “These are basic natural laws of life.” She described Hubbard as “an engineer” who had codified human emotional states, in order to guide people to “feel a zest and a love for life.” 

I asked them how the controversy surrounding Scientology had affected them. “It hasn’t touched me,” Archer said. “It’s not that I’m not aware of it.” She went on, “Scientology is growing. It’s in a hundred and sixty-five countries.”

“Translated into fifty languages!” Jastrow added. “It’s the fastest-growing religion.” He added, “Scientologists do more good things for more people in more places around the world than any other organization ever.” He continued, “When you study the historical perspective of new faiths, historically, they’ve all been—”

“Attacked,” Archer said. “Look what happened to the—”

“The Christians,” Jastrow said, simultaneously. “Think of the Mormons and the Christian Scientists.”

We talked about the church’s focus on celebrities. “Hubbard recognized that if you really want to inspire a culture to have peace and greatness and harmony among men, you need to respect and help the artist to prosper and flourish,” Archer said. “And if he’s particularly well known he needs a place where he can be comfortable. Celebrity Centres provide that.” She blamed the press for concentrating too much on Scientology celebrities. Journalists, she said, “don’t write about the hundreds of thousands of other Scientologists—”

“Millions!”

“Millions of other Scientologists. They only write about four friggin’ people!” 

The church won’t release official membership figures, but it informally claims eight million members worldwide. Davis says that the figure comes from the number of people throughout the world who have donated to the church. “There is no process of conversion, there is no baptism,” Davis told me. It was a simple decision: “Either you are or you aren’t.” A survey of American religious affiliations, compiled in the Statistical Abstract of the United States, estimates that only twenty-five thousand Americans actually call themselves Scientologists. That’s less than half the number who identify themselves as Rastafarians. 

Jastrow suggested that Scientology’s critics often had a vested interest. He pointed to psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors, drugmakers, pharmacies—“all those people who make a living and profit and pay their mortgages and pay their college educations and buy their cars, et cetera, et cetera, based on people not being well.” He cited a recent article in USA Today which noted that an alarmingly high number of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan had been hospitalized for mental illness. Drugs merely mask mental distress, he said, whereas “Scientology will solve the source of the problem.” The medical and pharmaceutical industries are “prime funders and sponsors of the media,” he said, and therefore might exert “influence on people telling the whole and true story about Scientology just because of the profit motive.”

Scientology has perpetuated Hubbard’s antagonism toward psychiatry. An organization that the church co-founded, the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, maintains a permanent exhibit in Los Angeles called “Psychiatry: An Industry of Death,” which argues that psychiatry contributed to the rise of Nazism and apartheid. The group is behind an effort “to help achieve legislative protections against abusive psychiatric treatment and drugging of children.” (Paul Haggis has hosted an event for the organization at his home. His defection from Scientology has not changed his view that “psychotropic drugs are overprescribed for children.”)

Jastrow, in his back yard, told me, “Scientology is going to be huge, and it’s going to help mankind right itself.” He asked me, “What else is there that we can hang our hopes on?”

“That’s improving the civilization,” Archer added.

“Is there some other religion on the horizon that’s gonna help mankind?” he said. “Just tell me where. If not Scientology, where?”

Archer and Jastrow found their way into Scientology in the mid-seventies, but Tommy Davis was reared in Archer’s original faith, Christian Science. He never met L. Ron Hubbard. He was thirteen years old on January 24, 1986, the day Hubbard died. Although Davis grew up amid money and celebrity, he impressed people with his modesty and his idealism. Like Paul Haggis, Davis was first drawn to the church because of romantic problems. In 1996, he told Details that, when he was seventeen, he was having trouble with a girlfriend, and went to his mother for advice. Archer suggested that he go to the Celebrity Centre. After taking the Personal Values and Integrity course, Davis became a Scientologist.

In 1990, Davis was accepted at Columbia University. But, according to the defector John Peeler—who was then the secretary to Karen Hollander, the president of the Celebrity Centre—pressure was put on Davis to join the Sea Org. Hollander, Peeler says, wanted Tommy to be her personal assistant. “Karen felt that because of who his parents were, and the fact that he already had close friendships with other celebrities, he’d be a good fit,” Peeler said. “Whenever celebrities came in, there would be Anne Archer’s son.” At first, Davis resisted. “He wanted to go to college,” Peeler said. 

That fall, Davis entered Columbia. He attended for a semester, then dropped out and joined the Sea Org. “I always wanted to do something that helped people,” Davis explained to me. “I didn’t think the world needed another doctor or lawyer.” Archer and Jastrow say that they were surprised by Tommy’s decision. “We were hoping he’d get his college education,” Jastrow said. 

Davis became fiercely committed to the Sea Org. He got a tattoo on one arm of its logo—two palm fronds embracing a star, supposedly the emblem of the Galactic Confederacy seventy-five million years ago. He began working at the Celebrity Centre, attending to young stars like Juliette Lewis, before taking on Tom Cruise. David Miscavige was impressed with Davis. Mike Rinder recalled, “Miscavige liked the fact that he was young and looked trendy and wore Armani suits.”

Paul Haggis remembers first meeting Davis at the Celebrity Centre in the early nineties. “He was a sweet and bright boy,” Haggis said. 

Davis’s rise within Scientology was not without difficulty. In 2005, Davis was sent to Clearwater to participate in something called the Estates Project Force. He was there at the same time as Donna Shannon, a veterinarian who had become an O.T. VII before joining the Sea Org. She had thought that she was attending a kind of boot camp for new Sea Org members, and was surprised to see veterans like Davis. She says that Davis, “a pretty nice guy,” was subjected to extensive hazing. “He complained about scrubbing a Dumpster with a toothbrush till late at night,” she recalls. “Then he’d be up at six to do our laundry.” Only later did Shannon learn that Davis was Anne Archer’s son.

Shannon and Davis worked together for a while in Clearwater, maintaining the grounds. “I was supposedly supervising him,” Shannon says. “I was told to make him work really hard.” At one point, Shannon says, Davis borrowed about a hundred dollars from her because he didn’t have money for food. 

One day, according to Shannon, she and Davis were taking the bus to a work project. She asked why he was in the E.P.F.

“I got busted,” Davis told her. Using Scientology jargon, he said, “I fucked up on Tom Cruise’s lines”—meaning that he had botched a project that Cruise was involved in. “I just want to do my stuff and get back on post.” 

Shannon recalled that, suddenly, “it was like a veil went over his eyes, and he goes, ‘I already said too much.’ ”

Several months later, Davis paid her back the money. (Davis says that he does not recall meeting Shannon, has never scrubbed a Dumpster, and has never had a need to borrow money.)

Davis ascended to his role as spokesman in 2007. He has since become known for his aggressive defenses of the church. In 2007, the BBC began reporting an investigative story about Scientology. From the start, the BBC crew, led by John Sweeney, was shadowed by a Scientology film crew. Davis travelled across the U.S. to disrupt Sweeney’s interviews with Scientology dissidents. The two men had a number of confrontations. In an incident captured on video in Florida, Sweeney suggests that Scientology is “a sadistic cult.” Davis responds, “For you to repeatedly refer to my faith in those terms is so derogatory, so offensive, and so bigoted. And the reason you kept repeating it is because you wanted to get a reaction like you’re getting right now. Well, buddy, you got it! Right here, right now, I’m angry! Real angry!” The two men had another encounter that left Sweeney screaming as Davis goaded him—an incident so raw that Sweeney apologized to his viewers. 

Shortly afterward, in March, 2007, Davis mysteriously disappeared. He was under considerable stress. According to Mike Rinder, Davis had told Sweeney that he reported to Miscavige every day, and that angered Miscavige, who wanted to be seen as focussed on spiritual matters, not public relations. According to Rinder, Davis “blew.” A few days later, he surfaced in Las Vegas. Davis was sent to Clearwater, where he was “security-checked” by Jessica Feshbach, a church stalwart. A security check involves seeking to gain a confession with an E-Meter, in order to rout out subversion. It can function as a powerful form of thought control. 

Davis claims that he never fled the church and was not in Las Vegas. He did go to Clearwater. “I went to Florida and worked there for a year and took some time off,” he told me. “I did a lot of study, a lot of auditing.” He and Feshbach subsequently got married. 

When I first contacted Tommy Davis, last April, he expressed a reluctance to talk, saying that he had already spent a month responding to Paul Haggis. “It made little difference,” he said. “The last thing I’m interested in is dredging all this up again.” He kept putting me off, saying that he was too busy to get together, but he promised that we would meet when he was more available. In an e-mail, he said, “We should plan on spending at least a full day together as there is a lot I would want to show you.” We finally arranged to meet on Memorial Day weekend. 

I flew to Los Angeles and waited for him to call. On Sunday at three o’clock, Davis appeared at my hotel, with Feshbach. We sat at a table on the patio. Davis has his mother’s sleepy eyes. His thick black hair was combed forward, with a lock falling boyishly onto his forehead. He wore a wheat-colored suit with a blue shirt. Feshbach, a slender, attractive woman, anxiously twirled her hair. 

Davis now told me that he was “not willing to participate in, or contribute to, an article about Scientology through the lens of Paul Haggis.” I had come to Los Angeles specifically to talk to him, at a time he had chosen. I asked if he had been told not to talk to me. He said no.

Feshbach said that she had spoken to Mark Isham, whom I had interviewed the day before. “He talked to you about what are supposed to be our confidential scriptures.” Any discussion of the church’s secret doctrines was offensive, she said. 

In my meeting with Isham, he asserted that Scientology was not a “faith-based religion.” I pointed out that, in Scientology’s upper levels, there was a cosmology that would have to be accepted on faith. Isham said that he wasn’t going to discuss the details of O.T. III. “In the wrong hands, it can hurt people,” he said.

“Everything I have to say about Paul, I’ve already said,” Davis told me. He agreed, however, to respond to written questions about the church. 

In late September, Davis and Feshbach, along with four attorneys representing the church, travelled to Manhattan to meet with me and six staff members of The New Yorker. In response to nearly a thousand queries, the Scientology delegation handed over forty-eight binders of supporting material, stretching nearly seven linear feet.

Davis, early in his presentation, attacked the credibility of Scientology defectors, whom he calls “bitter apostates.” He said, “They make up stories.” He cited Bryan Wilson, an Oxford sociologist, who has argued that testimony from the disaffected should be treated skeptically, noting, “The apostate is generally in need of self-justification. He seeks to reconstruct his own past to excuse his former affiliations and to blame those who were formerly his closest associates.” 

Davis spoke about Gerry Armstrong, a former Scientology archivist who copied, without permission, many of the church’s files on Hubbard, and who settled in a fraud suit against the church in 1986. Davis charged that Armstrong had forged many of the documents that he later disseminated in order to discredit the church’s founder. He also alleged that Armstrong had spread rumors of a 1967 letter in which Hubbard told his wife that he was “drinking lots of rum and popping pinks and grays” while researching the Operating Thetan material. Davis also noted that, in 1984, Armstrong had been captured on videotape telling a friend, “I can create documents with relative ease. You know, I did for a living.” Davis’s decision to cite this evidence was curious—though the quote cast doubt on Armstrong’s ethics, it also suggested that forging documents had once been part of a Scientologist’s job.

Davis passed around a photograph of Armstrong, which, he said, showed Armstrong “sitting naked” with a giant globe in his lap. “This was a photo that was in a newspaper article he did where he said that all people should give up money,” Davis said. “He’s not a very sane person.” 

Armstrong told me that, in the photo, he is actually wearing running shorts under the globe. The article is about his attempt to create a movement for people to “abandon the use of currency.” He said that he received eight hundred thousand dollars in the 1986 settlement and had given most of the money away. (The settlement prohibited Armstrong from talking about Scientology, a prohibition that he has ignored, and the church has won two breach-of-contract suits against him, including a five-hundred-thousand-dollar judgment in 2004.)

Davis also displayed photographs of what he said were bruises sustained by Mike Rinder’s former wife in 2010, after Rinder physically assaulted her in a Florida parking lot. (Rinder denies committing any violence. A sheriff’s report supports this.) Davis also showed a mug shot of Marty Rathbun in a jailhouse jumpsuit, after being arrested in New Orleans last July for public drunkenness. “Getting arrested for being drunk on the intersection of Bourbon and Toulouse?” Davis cracked. “That’s like getting arrested for being a leper in a leper colony.” (Rathbun’s arrest has been expunged.) Claire and Marc Headley were “the most despicable people in the world”; Jeff Hawkins was “an inveterate liar.” 

I asked how, if these people were so reprehensible, they had all arrived at such elevated positions in the church. “They weren’t like that when they were in those positions,” Davis responded. The defectors we were discussing had not only risen to positions of responsibility within the church; they had also ascended Scientology’s ladder of spiritual accomplishment. I suggested to Davis that Scientology didn’t seem to work if people at the highest levels of spiritual attainment were actually liars, adulterers, wife beaters, and embezzlers. 

Scientology, Davis said, doesn’t pretend to be perfect, and it shouldn’t be judged on the misconduct of a few apostates. “I haven’t done things like that,” Davis said. “I haven’t suborned perjury, destroyed evidence, lied—contrary to what Paul Haggis says.” He spoke of his frustration with Haggis after his resignation: “If he was so troubled and shaken on the fundamentals of Scientology . . . then why the hell did he stick around for thirty-five years?” He continued, “Did he stay a closet Scientologist for some career-advancement purpose?” Davis shook his head in disgust. “I think he’s the most hypocritical person in the world.” 

We discussed the allegations of abuse lodged against Miscavige. “The only people who will corroborate are their fellow-apostates,” Davis said. He produced affidavits from other Scientologists refuting the accusations, and noted that the tales about Miscavige always hinged on “inexplicable violent outbursts.” Davis said, “One would think that if such a thing occurred—which it most certainly did not—there’d have to be a reason.” 

I had wondered about these stories as well. While Rinder and Rathbun were in the church, they had repeatedly claimed that allegations of abuse were baseless. Then, after Rinder defected, he said that Miscavige had beaten him fifty times. Rathbun has confessed that, in 1997, he ordered incriminating documents destroyed in the case of Lisa McPherson, the Scientologist who died of an embolism. If these men were capable of lying to protect the church, might they not also be capable of lying to destroy it? Davis later claimed that Rathbun is in fact trying to overthrow Scientology’s current leadership and take over the church. (Rathbun now makes his living by providing Hubbard-inspired counselling to other defectors, but he says that he has no desire to be part of a hierarchical organization. “Power corrupts,” he says.) 

Twelve other defectors told me that they had been beaten by Miscavige, or had witnessed Miscavige beating other church staff members. Most of them, like John Peeler, noted that Miscavige’s demeanor changed “like the snap of a finger.” Others who never saw such violence spoke of their constant fear of the leader’s anger.

At the meeting, Davis brought up Jack Parsons’s black-magic society, which Hubbard had supposedly infiltrated. Davis said, “He was sent in there by Robert Heinlein”—the science-fiction writer—“who was running off-book intelligence operations for naval intelligence at the time.” Davis said, “A biography that just came out three weeks ago on Bob Heinlein actually confirmed it at a level that we’d never been able to before.” The book to which Davis was referring is the first volume of an authorized Heinlein biography, by William H. Patterson, Jr. There is no mention in the book of Heinlein’s sending Hubbard to break up the Parsons ring, on the part of naval intelligence or any other organization. Patterson says that he looked into the matter, at the suggestion of Scientologists, but found nothing.

Davis and I discussed an assertion that Marty Rathbun had made to me about the O.T. III creation story—the galactic revelations that Haggis had deemed “madness.” While Hubbard was in exile, Rathbun told me, he wrote a memo suggesting an experiment in which ascending Scientologists skipped the O.T. III level. Miscavige shelved the idea, Rathbun told me. Davis called Rathbun’s story “libellous.” He explained that the cornerstone of Scientology was the writings of L. Ron Hubbard. “Mr. Hubbard’s material must be and is applied precisely as written,” Davis said. “It’s never altered. It’s never changed. And there probably is no more heretical or more horrific transgression that you could have in the Scientology religion than to alter the technology.” 

But hadn’t certain derogatory references to homosexuality found in some editions of Hubbard’s books been changed after his death? 

Davis admitted that that was so, but he maintained that “the current editions are one-hundred-per-cent, absolutely fully verified as being according to what Mr. Hubbard wrote.” Davis said they were checked against Hubbard’s original dictation. 

“The extent to which the references to homosexuality have changed are because of mistaken dictation?” I asked.

“No, because of the insertion, I guess, of somebody who was a bigot,” Davis replied. 

“Somebody put the material in those—?”

“I can only imagine. . . . It wasn’t Mr. Hubbard,” Davis said, cutting me off. 

“Who would’ve done it?”

“I have no idea.”

“Hmm.”

“I don’t think it really matters,” Davis said. “The point is that neither Mr. Hubbard nor the church has any opinion on the subject of anyone’s sexual orientation. . . .”

“Someone inserted words that were not his into literature that was propagated under his name, and that’s been corrected now?” I asked.

“Yeah, I can only assume that’s what happened,” Davis said.

After this exchange, I looked at some recent editions that the church had provided me with. On page 125 of “Dianetics,” a “sexual pervert” is defined as someone engaging in “homosexuality, lesbianism, sexual sadism, etc.” Apparently, the bigot’s handiwork was not fully excised. 

At the meeting, Davis and I also discussed Hubbard’s war record. His voice filling with emotion, he said that, if it was true that Hubbard had not been injured, then “the injuries that he handled by the use of Dianetics procedures were never handled, because they were injuries that never existed; therefore, Dianetics is based on a lie; therefore, Scientology is based on a lie.” He concluded, “The fact of the matter is that Mr. Hubbard was a war hero.” 

In the binders that Davis provided, there was a letter from the U.S. Naval Hospital in Oakland, dated December 1, 1945. The letter states that Hubbard had been hospitalized that year for a duodenal ulcer, but was “technically pronounced ‘fit for duty.’ ” This was the same period during which Hubbard claimed to have been blinded and lame. Davis had highlighted a passage: “Eyesight very poor, beginning with conjunctivitis actinic in 1942. Lame in right hip from service connected injury. Infection in bone. Not misconduct, all service connected.” Davis added later that, according to Robert Heinlein, Hubbard’s ankles had suffered a “drumhead-type injury”; this can result, Davis explained, “when the ship is torpedoed or bombed.”

Davis acknowledged that some of Hubbard’s medical records did not appear to corroborate Hubbard’s version of events. But Scientology had culled other records that did confirm Hubbard’s story, including documents from the National Archives in St. Louis. The man who did the research, Davis said, was “Mr. X.” 

Davis explained, “Anyone who saw ‘J.F.K.’ remembers a scene on the Mall where Kevin Costner’s character goes and meets with a man named Mr. X, who’s played by Donald Sutherland.” In the film, Mr. X is an embittered intelligence agent who explains that the Kennedy assassination was actually a coup staged by the military-industrial complex. In real life, Davis said, Mr. X was Colonel Leroy Fletcher Prouty, who had worked in the Office of Special Operations. (Oliver Stone, who directed “J.F.K.,” says that Mr. X was a composite character, based in part on Prouty.) In the eighties, Prouty worked as a consultant for Scientology. 

“We finally got so frustrated with this point of conflicting medical records that we took all of Mr. Hubbard’s records to Fletcher Prouty,” Davis told me. “He actually solved the conundrum for us.” According to Davis, Prouty explained to the church representatives that, because Hubbard had an “intelligence background,” his records were subjected to a process known as “sheep-dipping.” Davis explained that this was military parlance for “what gets done to a set of records for an intelligence officer. And, essentially, they create two sets.” He said, “Fletcher Prouty basically issued an affidavit saying L. Ron Hubbard’s records were sheep-dipped.” Prouty died in 2001. 

Davis later sent me a copy of what he said was a document that confirmed Hubbard’s heroism: a “Notice of Separation from the U.S. Naval Service,” dated December 6, 1945. The document specifies medals won by Hubbard, including a Purple Heart with a Palm, implying that he was wounded in action twice. But John E. Bircher, the spokesman for the Military Order of the Purple Heart, wrote to me that the Navy uses gold and silver stars, “NOT a palm,” to indicate multiple wounds. Davis included a photograph of medals that Hubbard supposedly won. Two of the medals in the photograph weren’t even created until after Hubbard left active service. 

After filing a request with the National Archives in St. Louis, The New Yorker obtained what archivists assured us were Hubbard’s complete military records—more than nine hundred pages. Nowhere in the file is there mention of Hubbard’s being wounded in battle or breaking his feet. X-rays taken of Hubbard’s right shoulder and hip showed calcium deposits, but there was no evidence of any bone or joint disease in his ankle. 

There is a “Notice of Separation” in the records, but it is not the one that Davis sent me. The differences in the two documents are telling. The St. Louis document indicates that Hubbard earned four medals for service, but they reflect no distinction or valor. In the church document, his job preference after the service is listed as “Studio (screen writing)”; in the official record, it is “uncertain.” The church document indicates, falsely, that Hubbard completed four years of college, obtaining a degree in civil engineering. The official document correctly notes two years of college and no degree. 

On the church document, the commanding officer who signed off on Hubbard’s separation was “Howard D. Thompson, Lt. Cmdr.” The file contains a letter, from 2000, to another researcher, who had written for more information about Thompson. An analyst with the National Archives responded that the records of commissioned naval officers at that time had been reviewed, and “there was no Howard D. Thompson listed.” 

The church, after being informed of these discrepancies, said, “Our expert on military records has advised us that, in his considered opinion, there is nothing in the Thompson notice that would lead him to question its validity.” Eric Voelz, an archivist who has worked at the St. Louis archive for three decades, looked at the document and pronounced it a forgery. 

Since leaving the church, Haggis has been in therapy, which he has found helpful. He’s learned how much he blames others for his problems, especially those who are closest to him. “I really wish I had found a good therapist when I was twenty-one,” he said. In Scientology, he always felt a subtle pressure to impress his auditor and then write up a glowing success story. Now, he said, “I’m not fooling myself that I’m a better man than I am.”

Recently, he and Rennard separated. They have moved to the same neighborhood in New York, so that they can share custody of their son. Rennard has also decided to leave the church. Both say that the divorce has nothing to do with their renunciation of Scientology.

On November 9th, “The Next Three Days” premièred at the Ziegfeld Theatre, in Manhattan. Movie stars lined up on the red carpet as photographers fired away. Jason Beghe, who plays a detective in the film, was there. He told me that he had taken in a young man, Daniel Montalvo, who had recently blown. He was placed in the Cadet Org, a junior version of the Sea Org, at age five, and joined the Sea Org at eleven. “He’s never seen television,” Beghe said. “He doesn’t even know who Robert Redford is.” 

After the screening, everyone drifted over to the Oak Room of the Plaza Hotel. Haggis was in a corner receiving accolades from his friends when I found him. I asked him if he felt that he had finally left Scientology. “I feel much more myself, but there’s a sadness,” he admitted. “If you identify yourself with something for so long, and suddenly you think of yourself as not that thing, it leaves a bit of space.” He went on, “It’s not really the sense of a loss of community. Those people who walked away from me were never really my friends.” He understood how they felt about him, and why. “In Scientology, in the Ethics Conditions, as you go down from Normal through Doubt, then you get to Enemy, and, finally, near the bottom, there is Treason. What I did was a treasonous act.” 

I once asked Haggis about the future of his relationship with Scientology. “These people have long memories,” he told me. “My bet is that, within two years, you’re going to read something about me in a scandal that looks like it has nothing to do with the church.” He thought for a moment, then said, “I was in a cult for thirty-four years. Everyone else could see it. I don’t know why I couldn’t.” ♦

The terse, typewritten note slipped under my door in a sealed envelope confirmed my appointment with India’s Gravest Internal Security Threat. I’d been waiting for months to hear from them. I had to be at the Ma Danteshwari mandir in Dantewada, Chhattisgarh, at any of four given times on two given days. That was to take care of bad weather, punctures, blockades, transport strikes and sheer bad luck. The note said: “Writer should have camera, tika and coconut. Meeter will have cap, Hindi Outlook magazine and bananas. Password: Namashkar Guruji.”

Namashkar Guruji. I wondered whether the Meeter and Greeter would be expecting a man. And whether I should get myself a moustache. 

There are many ways to describe Dantewada. It’s an oxymoron. It’s a border town smack in the heart of India. It’s the epicentre of a war. It’s an upside down, inside out town.


Red Shadow: Centenary celebrations of the adivasi uprising in Bastar; Sten gun at hand 

In Dantewada, the police wear plain clothes and the rebels wear uniforms. The jail superintendent is in jail. The prisoners are free (three hundred of them escaped from the old town jail two years ago). Women who have been raped are in police custody. The rapists give speeches in the bazaar.

 Across the Indravati river, in the area controlled by the Maoists, is the place the police call ‘Pakistan’. There the villages are empty, but the forest is full of people. Children who ought to be in school run wild. In the lovely forest villages, the concrete school buildings have either been blown up and lie in a heap, or they are full of policemen. The deadly war that is unfolding in the jungle is a war that the Government of India is both proud and shy of. Operation Green Hunt has been proclaimed as well as denied. P. Chidambaram, India’s home minister (and CEO of the war), says it does not exist, that it’s a media creation. And yet substantial funds have been allocated to it and tens of thousands of troops are being mobilised for it. Though the theatre of war is in the jungles of Central India, it will have serious consequences for us all.

 If ghosts are the lingering spirits of someone, or something, that has ceased to exist, then perhaps the new four-lane highway crashing through the forest is the opposite of a ghost. Perhaps it is the harbinger of what is still to come.

The antagonists in the forest are disparate and unequal in almost every way. On one side is a massive paramilitary force armed with the money, the firepower, the media, and the hubris of an emerging Superpower. On the other, ordinary villagers armed with traditional weapons, backed by a superbly organised, hugely motivated Maoist guerrilla fighting force with an extraordinary and violent history of armed rebellion. The Maoists and the paramilitary are old adversaries and have fought older avatars of each other several times before: Telangana in the ’50s; West Bengal, Bihar, Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh in the late ’60s and ’70s; and then again in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra from the ’80s all the way through to the present. They are familiar with each other’s tactics, and have studied each other’s combat manuals closely. Each time, it seemed as though the Maoists (or their previous avatars) had been not just defeated, but literally, physically exterminated. Each time, they have re-emerged, more organised, more determined and more influential than ever. Today once again the insurrection has spread through the mineral-rich forests of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa and West Bengal—homeland to millions of India’s tribal people, dreamland to the corporate world.

 It’s easier on the liberal conscience to believe that the war in the forests is a war between the Government of India and the Maoists, who call elections a sham, Parliament a pigsty and have openly declared their intention to overthrow the Indian State. It’s convenient to forget that tribal people in Central India have a history of resistance that predates Mao by centuries. (That’s a truism of course. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t exist.) The Ho, the Oraon, the Kols, the Santhals, the Mundas and the Gonds have all rebelled several times, against the British, against zamindars and moneylenders. The rebellions were cruelly crushed, many thousands killed, but the people were never conquered. Even after Independence, tribal people were at the heart of the first uprising that could be described as Maoist, in Naxalbari village in West Bengal (where the word Naxalite—now used interchangeably with ‘Maoist’—originates). Since then, Naxalite politics has been inextricably entwined with tribal uprisings, which says as much about the tribals as it does about the Naxalites.


Staying Put: People of Kudur village protest the Bodhghat dam: ‘It does not belong to the capitalists, Bastar is OUrs’y

This legacy of rebellion has left behind a furious people who have been deliberately isolated and marginalised by the Indian government. The Indian Constitution, the moral underpinning of Indian democracy, was adopted by Parliament in 1950. It was a tragic day for tribal people. The Constitution ratified colonial policy and made the State custodian of tribal homelands. Overnight, it turned the entire tribal population into squatters on their own land. It denied them their traditional rights to forest produce, it criminalised a whole way of life. In exchange for the right to vote, it snatched away their right to livelihood and dignity.

 Having dispossessed them and pushed them into a downward spiral of indigence, in a cruel sleight of hand, the government began to use their own penury against them. Each time it needed to displace a large population—for dams, irrigation projects, mines—it talked of “bringing tribals into the mainstream” or of giving them “the fruits of modern development”. Of the tens of millions of internally displaced people (more than 30 million by big dams alone), refugees of India’s ‘progress’, the great majority are tribal people. When the government begins to talk of tribal welfare, it’s time to worry.

 The most recent expression of concern has come from home minister P. Chidambaram who says he doesn’t want tribal people living in “museum cultures”. The well-being of tribal people didn’t seem to be such a priority during his career as a corporate lawyer, representing the interests of several major mining companies. So it might be an idea to enquire into the basis for his new anxiety.


The Day of the Bhumkal: Face to face with "India's greatest Security Threat".

Over the past five years or so, the governments of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa and West Bengal have signed hundreds of MoUs with corporate houses, worth several billion dollars, all of them secret, for steel plants, sponge-iron factories, power plants, aluminium refineries, dams and mines. In order for the MoUs to translate into real money, tribal people must be moved.

 Therefore, this war.

 When a country that calls itself a democracy openly declares war within its borders, what does that war look like? Does the resistance stand a chance? Should it? Who are the Maoists? Are they just violent nihilists foisting an outdated ideology on tribal people, goading them into a hopeless insurrection? What lessons have they learned from their past experience? Is armed struggle intrinsically undemocratic? Is the Sandwich Theory—of ‘ordinary’ tribals being caught in the crossfire between the State and the Maoists—an accurate one? Are ‘Maoists’ and ‘Tribals’ two entirely discrete categories as is being made out? Do their interests converge? Have they learned anything from each other? Have they changed each other?

The day before I left, my mother called, sounding sleepy. “I’ve been thinking,” she said, with a mother’s weird instinct, “what this country needs is revolution.”

An article on the internet says that Israel’s Mossad is training 30 high-ranking Indian police officers in the techniques of targeted assassinations, to render the Maoist organisation “headless”. There’s talk in the press about the new hardware that has been bought from Israel: laser range-finders, thermal imaging equipment and unmanned drones, so popular with the US army. Perfect weapons to use against the poor.

 The drive from Raipur to Dantewada takes about 10 hours through areas known to be ‘Maoist-infested’. These are not careless words. ‘Infest/infestation’ implies disease/pests. Diseases must be cured. Pests must be exterminated. Maoists must be wiped out. In these creeping, innocuous ways, the language of genocide has entered our vocabulary.

 To protect the highway, security forces have ‘secured’ a narrow bandwidth of forest on either side. Further in, it’s the raj of the ‘Dada log’. The Brothers. The Comrades.

 On the outskirts of Raipur, a massive billboard advertises Vedanta (the company our home minister once worked with) Cancer Hospital. In Orissa, where it is mining bauxite, Vedanta is financing a university. In these creeping, innocuous ways, mining corporations enter our imaginations: the Gentle Giants Who Really Care. It’s called CSR, Corporate Social Responsibility. It allows mining companies to be like the legendary actor and former chief minister NTR, who liked to play all the parts in Telugu mythologicals—the good guys and the bad guys, all at once, in the same movie. This CSR masks the outrageous economics that underpins the mining sector in India. For example, according to the recent Lokayukta report for Karnataka, for every tonne of iron ore mined by a private company, the government gets a royalty of Rs 27 and the mining company makes Rs 5,000. In the bauxite and aluminium sector, the figures are even worse. We’re talking about daylight robbery to the tune of billions of dollars. Enough to buy elections, governments, judges, newspapers, TV channels, NGOs and aid agencies. What’s the occasional cancer hospital here or there?

 I don’t remember seeing Vedanta’s name on the long list of MoUs signed by the Chhattisgarh government. But I’m twisted enough to suspect that if there’s a cancer hospital, there must be a flat-topped bauxite mountain somewhere.




  
 
  

 Tribal people in central India have a history of resistance predating Mao. The rebellions were crushed, but the people were never conquered.  

  
 
  
 

We pass Kanker, famous for its Counter Terrorism and Jungle Warfare College run by Brigadier B.K. Ponwar, Rumpelstiltskin of this war, charged with the task of turning corrupt, sloppy policemen (straw) into jungle commandos (gold). “Fight a guerrilla like a guerrilla”, the motto of the warfare training school, is painted on the rocks. The men are taught to run, slither, jump on and off air-borne helicopters, ride horses (for some reason), eat snakes and live off the jungle. The brigadier takes great pride in training street dogs to fight ‘terrorists’. Eight hundred policemen graduate from the warfare training school every six weeks. Twenty similar schools are being planned all over India. The police force is gradually being turned into an army. (In Kashmir, it’s the other way around. The army is being turned into a bloated, administrative police force.) Upside down. Inside out. Either way, the Enemy is the People.

 It’s late. Jagdalpur is asleep, except for the many hoardings of Rahul Gandhi asking people to join the Youth Congress. He’s been to Bastar twice in recent months but hasn’t said anything much about the war. It’s probably too messy for the People’s Prince to meddle in at this point. His media managers must have put their foot down. The fact that the Salwa Judum—the dreaded, government-sponsored vigilante group responsible for rapes, killings, for burning down villages and driving hundreds of thousands of people from their homes—is led by Mahendra Karma, a Congress MLA, does not get much play in the carefully orchestrated publicity around Rahul Gandhi.

I arrived at the Ma Danteshwari mandir well in time for my appointment (first day, first show). I had my camera, my small coconut and a powdery red tika on my forehead. I wondered if someone was watching me and having a laugh. Within minutes a young boy approached me. He had a cap and a backpack schoolbag. Chipped red nail-polish on his fingernails. No Hindi Outlook, no bananas. “Are you the one who’s going in?” he asked me. No Namashkar Guruji. I did not know what to say. He took out a soggy note from his pocket and handed it to me. It said, “Outlook nahin mila (couldn’t find Outlook).”

 “And the bananas?”

 “I ate them,” he said, “I got hungry.”

He really was a security threat.

 His backpack said Charlie Brown—Not your ordinary blockhead. He said his name was Mangtu. I soon learned that Dandakaranya, the forest I was about to enter, was full of people who had many names and fluid identities. It was like balm to me, that idea. How lovely not to be stuck with yourself, to become someone else for a while.




  
 
  

 I’m surrounded by strange, beautiful children with their curious arsenal—all Maoists. Are they going to die? What for? To turn this into a mine?  

  
 
  
 

We walked to the bus stand, only a few minutes away from the temple. It was already crowded. Things happened quickly. There were two men on motorbikes. There was no conversation—just a glance of acknowledgment, a shifting of body weight, the revving of engines. I had no idea where we were going. We passed the house of the Superintendent of Police (SP), which I recognised from my last visit. He was a candid man, the SP: “See Ma’am, frankly speaking this problem can’t be solved by us police or military. The problem with these tribals is they don’t understand greed. Unless they become greedy, there’s no hope for us. I have told my boss, remove the force and instead put a TV in every home. Everything will be automatically sorted out.”

In no time at all we were riding out of town. No tail. It was a long ride, three hours by my watch. It ended abruptly in the middle of nowhere, on an empty road with forest on either side. Mangtu got off. I did too. The bikes left, and I picked up my backpack and followed the small internal security threat into the forest. It was a beautiful day. The forest floor was a carpet of gold.

 In a while we emerged on the white, sandy banks of a broad flat river. It was obviously monsoon-fed, so now it was more or less a sand flat, at the centre a stream, ankle deep, easy to wade across. Across was ‘Pakistan’. “Out there, ma’am,” the candid SP had said to me, “my boys shoot to kill.” I remembered that as we began to cross. I saw us in a policeman’s rifle-sights—tiny figures in a landscape, easy to pick off. But Mangtu seemed quite unconcerned, and I took my cue from him.

 Waiting for us on the other bank, in a lime-green shirt that said Horlicks!, was Chandu. A slightly older security threat. Maybe twenty. He had a lovely smile, a cycle, a jerry can with boiled water and many packets of glucose biscuits for me, from the Party. We caught our breath and began to walk again. The cycle, it turned out, was a red herring. The route was almost entirely non-cycleable. We climbed steep hills and clambered down rocky paths along some pretty precarious ledges. When he couldn’t wheel it, Chandu lifted the cycle and carried it over his head as though it weighed nothing. I began to wonder about his bemused village boy air. I discovered (much later) that he could handle every kind of weapon, “except for an LMG”, he informed me cheerfully.




  
 
  

 CSR. It allows corporates to play good guys and bad guys all at once. If Vedanta has a cancer hospital somewhere, a bauxite mountain can’t be far.  

  
 
  
 

Three beautiful, sozzled men with flowers in their turbans walked with us for about half an hour, before our paths diverged. At sunset, their shoulder bags began to crow. They had roosters in them, which they had taken to market but hadn’t managed to sell.

 Chandu seems to be able to see in the dark. I have to use my torch. The crickets start up and soon there’s an orchestra, a dome of sound over us. I long to look up at the night sky, but I dare not. I have to keep my eyes on the ground. One step at a time. Concentrate.

 I hear dogs. But I can’t tell how far away they are. The terrain flattens out. I steal a look at the sky. It makes me ecstatic. I hope we’re going to stop soon. “Soon,” Chandu says. It turns out to be more than an hour. I see silhouettes of enormous trees. We arrive.

 The village seems spacious, the houses far away from each other. The house we enter is beautiful. There’s a fire, some people sitting around. More people outside, in the dark. I can’t tell how many. I can just about make them out. A murmur goes around. Lal Salaam Kaamraid (Red Salute, Comrade). Lal Salaam, I say. I’m beyond tired. The lady of the house calls me inside and gives me chicken curry cooked in green beans and some red rice. Fabulous. Her baby is asleep next to me, her silver anklets gleam in the firelight.

 After dinner, I unzip my sleeping bag. It’s a strange intrusive sound, the big zip. Someone puts on the radio. BBC Hindi service. The Church of England has withdrawn its funds from Vedanta’s Niyamgiri project, citing environmental degradation and rights violations of the Dongria Kondh tribe. I can hear cowbells, snuffling, shuffling, cattle-farting. All’s well with the world. My eyes close.


We’re up at five. On the move by six. In another couple of hours, we cross another river. We walk through some beautiful villages. Every village has a family of tamarind trees watching over it, like a clutch of huge, benevolent, gods. Sweet, Bastar tamarind. By 11, the sun is high, and walking is less fun. We stop at a village for lunch. Chandu seems to know the people in the house. A beautiful young girl flirts with him. He looks a little shy, maybe because I’m around. Lunch is raw papaya with masoor dal, and red rice. And red chilli powder. We’re going to wait for the sun to lose some of its vehemence before we start walking again. We take a nap in the gazebo. There is a spare beauty about the place. Everything is clean and necessary. No clutter. A black hen parades up and down the low mud wall. A bamboo grid stabilises the rafters of the thatched roof and doubles as a storage rack. There’s a grass broom, two drums, a woven reed basket, a broken umbrella and a whole stack of flattened, empty, corrugated cardboard boxes. Something catches my eye. I need my spectacles. Here’s what’s printed on the cardboard: Ideal Power 90 High Energy Emulsion Explosive (Class-2) SD CAT ZZ.

 We start walking again at about two. In the village we are going to meet a Didi (Sister, Comrade) who knows what the next step of the journey will be. Chandu doesn’t. There is an economy of information too. Nobody is supposed to know everything. But when we reach the village, Didi isn’t there. There is no news of her. For the first time, I see a little cloud of worry settling over Chandu. A big one settles over me. I don’t know what the systems of communication are, but what if they’ve gone wrong?


Spare Beauty: Pots, rifles, jhillies... Everything in these villages is clean and necessary

We’re parked outside a deserted school building, a little way out of the village. Why are all the government village schools built like concrete bastions, with steel shutters for windows and sliding folding steel doors? Why not like the village houses, with mud and thatch? Because they double up as barracks and bunkers. “In the villages in Abujhmad,” Chandu says, “schools are like this....” He scratches a building plan with a twig in the earth. Three octagons attached to each other like a honeycomb. “So they can fire in all directions.” He draws arrows to illustrate his point, like a cricket graphic—a batsman’s wagon wheel. There are no teachers in any of the schools, Chandu says. They’ve all run away. Or have you chased them away? No, we only chase police. But why should teachers come here, to the jungle, when they get their salaries sitting at home? Good point.

 He informs me that this is a ‘new area’. The Party has entered only recently.




  
 
  

 Rahul’s been to Bastar twice in recent months, but has said nothing on the war. Perhaps it’s too messy for the People’s Prince at this point.  

  
 
  
 

About 20 young people arrive, girls and boys. In their teens and early 20s. Chandu explains that this is the village-level militia, the lowest rung of the Maoists’ military hierarchy. I have never seen anyone like them before. They are dressed in saris and lungis, some in frayed olive-green fatigues. The boys wear jewellery, headgear. Every one of them has a muzzle-loading rifle, what’s called a bharmaar. Some also have knives, axes, a bow and arrow. One boy carries a crude mortar fashioned out of a heavy three-foot GI pipe. It’s filled with gunpowder and shrapnel and ready to be fired. It makes a big noise, but can only be used once. Still, it scares the police, they say, and giggle. War doesn’t seem to be uppermost on their minds. Perhaps because their area is outside the home range of the Salwa Judum. They have just finished a day’s work, helping to build fencing around some village houses to keep the goats out of the fields. They’re full of fun and curiosity. The girls are confident and easy with the boys. I have a sensor for this sort of thing, and I am impressed. Their job, Chandu says, is to patrol and protect a group of four or five villages and to help in the fields, clean wells or repair houses—doing whatever’s needed.

 Still no Didi. What to do? Nothing. Wait. Help out with some chopping and peeling.

 After dinner, without much talk, everybody falls in line. Clearly, we are moving. Everything moves with us, the rice, vegetables, pots and pans. We leave the school compound and walk single file into the forest. In less than half an hour, we arrive in a glade where we are going to sleep. There’s absolutely no noise. Within minutes everyone has spread their blue plastic sheets, the ubiquitous ‘jhilli’ (without which there will be no Revolution). Chandu and Mangtu share one and spread one out for me. They find me the best place, by the best grey rock. Chandu says he has sent a message to Didi. If she gets it, she will be here first thing in the morning. If she gets it.

 It’s the most beautiful room I have slept in, in a long time. My private suite in a thousand-star hotel. I’m surrounded by these strange, beautiful children with their curious arsenal. They’re all Maoists for sure. Are they all going to die? Is the jungle warfare training school for them? And the helicopter gunships, the thermal imaging and the laser range-finders?

 Why must they die? What for? To turn all of this into a mine? I remember my visit to the open cast iron-ore mines in Keonjhar, Orissa. There was forest there once. And children like these. Now the land is like a raw, red wound. Red dust fills your nostrils and lungs. The water is red, the air is red, the people are red, their lungs and hair are red. All day and all night trucks rumble through their villages, bumper to bumper, thousands and thousands of trucks, taking ore to Paradip port from where it will go to China. There it will turn into cars and smoke and sudden cities that spring up overnight. Into a ‘growth rate’ that leaves economists breathless. Into weapons to make war.

 Everyone’s asleep except for the sentries who take one-and-a-half-hour shifts. Finally, I can look at the stars. When I was a child growing up on the banks of the Meenachal river, I used to think the sound of crickets—which always started up at twilight—was the sound of stars revving up, getting ready to shine. I’m surprised at how much I love being here. There is nowhere else in the world that I would rather be. Who should I be tonight? Kamraid Rahel, under the stars? Maybe Didi will come tomorrow.

They arrive in the early afternoon. I can see them from a distance. About 15 of them, all in olive-green uniforms, running towards us. Even from a distance, from the way they run, I can tell they are the heavy hitters. The People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA). For whom the thermal imaging and laser-guided rifles. For whom the jungle warfare training school.




  
 
  

 In April ’05, the Chhattisgarh government signed two MoUs for steel plants. The same month, the PM called Maoists the ‘gravest security threat’.  

  
 
  
 

They carry serious rifles, INSAS, SLR, two have AK-47s. The leader of the squad is Comrade Madhav who has been with the Party since he was nine. He’s from Warangal, Andhra Pradesh. He’s upset and extremely apologetic. There was a major miscommunication, he says again and again, which usually never happens. I was supposed to have arrived at the main camp on the very first night. Someone dropped the baton in the jungle-relay. The motorcycle drop was to have been at an entirely different place. “We made you wait, we made you walk so much. We ran all the way when the message came that you were here.” I said it was okay, that I had come prepared, to wait and walk and listen. He wants to leave immediately, because people in the camp were waiting, and worried.

 It’s a few hours’ walk to the camp. It’s getting dark when we arrive. There are several layers of sentries and concentric circles of patrolling. There must be a hundred comrades lined up in two rows. Everyone has a weapon. And a smile. They begin to sing: Lal lal salaam, lal lal salaam, aane vaale saathiyon ko lal lal salaam (red salute to the comrades who have arrived). It is sung sweetly, as though it was a folk song about a river, or a forest blossom. With the song, the greeting, the handshake, and the clenched fist. Everyone greets everyone, murmuring Lalslaam, mlalslaa mlalslaam....




  
 
  

 I remember my visit to the iron ore mines in Keonjhar. Once it had forest. Now the land’s like a raw, red wound. Red water, red air, red people.  

  
 
  
 

Other than a large blue jhilli spread out on the floor, about 15 feet square, there are no signs of a ‘camp’. This one has a jhilli roof as well. It’s my room for the night. I was either being rewarded for my days of walking, or being pampered in advance for what lay ahead. Or both. Either way it was the last time in the entire trip that I was going to have a roof over my head. Over dinner I meet Comrade Narmada, in charge of the Krantikari Adivasi Mahila Sangathan (KAMS), who has a price on her head; Comrade Saroja of the PLGA who is only as tall as her SLR; Comrade Maase (which means Black Girl in Gondi), who has a price on her head too; Comrade Rupi, the tech wizard; Comrade Raju, who’s in charge of the division I’d been walking through; and Comrade Venu (or Murali or Sonu or Sushil, whatever you would like to call him), clearly the seniormost of them all. Maybe central committee, maybe even politburo. I’m not told, I don’t ask. Between us we speak Gondi, Halbi, Telugu, Punjabi and Malayalam. Only Maase speaks English. (So we all communicate in Hindi!) Comrade Maase is tall and quiet and seems to have to swim through a layer of pain to enter the conversation. But from the way she hugs me, I can tell she’s a reader. And that she misses having books in the jungle. She will tell me her story only later. When she trusts me with her grief.

 Bad news arrives, as it does in this jungle. A runner, with ‘biscuits’. Handwritten notes on sheets of paper, folded and stapled into little squares. There’s a bag full of them. Like chips. News from everywhere. The police have killed five people in Ongnaar village, four from the militia and one ordinary villager: Santhu Pottai (25), Phoolo Vadde (22), Kande Pottai (22), Ramoli Vadde (20), Dalsai Koram (22). They could have been the children in my star-spangled dormitory of last night.

 Then good news arrives. A small contingent of people with a plump young man. He’s in fatigues too, but they look brand new. Everybody admires them and comments on the fit. He looks shy and pleased. He’s a doctor who has come to live and work with the comrades in the forest. The last time a doctor visited Dandakaranya was many years ago.


Performing Arts: Members of the Chetna Natya Manch, the cultural wing of the party, waiting in the wings

On the radio there’s news about the home minister’s meeting with chief ministers of states ‘affected by Left-Wing Extremism’. The chief ministers of Jharkhand and Bihar are being demure and have not attended. Everybody sitting around the radio laughs. Around the time of elections, they say, right through the campaign, and then maybe a month or two after the government is formed, mainstream politicians all say things like “Naxals are our children”. You can set your watch to the schedule of when they will change their minds, and grow fangs.

 I am introduced to Comrade Kamla. I am told that I must on no account go even five feet away from my jhilli without waking her. Because everybody gets disoriented in the dark and could get seriously lost. (I don’t wake her. I sleep like a log.) In the morning Kamla presents me with a yellow polythene packet with one corner snipped off. Once it used to contain Abis Gold Refined Soya Oil. Now it was my Loo Mug. Nothing’s wasted on the Road to the Revolution.

 (Even now I think of Comrade Kamla all the time, every day. She’s 17. She wears a homemade pistol on her hip. And boy, what a smile. But if the police come across her, they’ll kill her. They might rape her first. No questions will be asked. Because she’s an Internal Security Threat.)

After breakfast, Comrade Venu (Sushil, Sonu, Murali) is waiting for me, sitting cross-legged on the jhilli, looking for all the world like a frail village schoolteacher. I’m going to get a history lesson. Or, more accurately, a lecture on the history of the last 30 years in the Dandakaranya forest, which has culminated in the war that’s swirling through it today. For sure, it’s a partisan’s version. But then, what history isn’t? In any case, the secret history must be made public if it is to be contested, argued with, instead of merely being lied about, which is what is happening now.




  
 
  

 Around the time of elections, mainstream netas say things like Naxals are our children. You can set your watch to when they’ll grow fangs.  

  
 
  
 

Comrade Venu has a calm, reassuring manner and a gentle voice that will, in the days to come, surface in a context that will completely unnerve me. This morning he talks for several hours, almost continuously. He’s like a little store manager who has a giant bunch of keys with which to open up a maze of lockers full of stories, songs and insights.

Comrade Venu was in one of the seven armed squads who crossed the Godavari from Andhra Pradesh and entered the Dandakaranya forest (DK, in Partyspeak) in June 1980, 30 years ago. He is one of the original forty-niners. They belonged to People’s War Group (PWG), a faction of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) or CPI(ML), the original Naxalites. PWG was formally announced as a separate, independent party in April that year, under Kondapalli Seetharamiah. PWG had decided to build a standing army, for which it would need a base. DK was to be that base, and those first squads were sent in to reconnoitre the area and begin the process of building guerrilla zones. The debate about whether communist parties ought to have a standing army, and whether or not a ‘people’s army’ is a contradiction in terms, is an old one. PWG’s decision to build an army came from its experience in Andhra Pradesh, where its ‘Land to the Tiller’ campaign led to a direct clash with the landlords, and resulted in the kind of police repression that the party found impossible to withstand without a trained fighting force of its own.

 (By 2004, PWG had merged with the other CPI(ML) factions, Party Unity (PU) and the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC)—which functions for the most part out of Bihar and Jharkhand. To become what it is now, the Communist Party of India-Maoist.)


Dandakaranya is part of what the British, in their White Man’s way, called Gondwana, land of the Gonds. Today the state boundaries of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra slice through the forest. Breaking up a troublesome people into separate administrative units is an old trick. But these Maoists and Maoist Gonds don’t pay much attention to things like state boundaries. They have different maps in their heads, and like other creatures of the forest, they have their own paths. For them, roads are not meant for walking on. They’re meant only to be crossed, or as is increasingly becoming the case, ambushed. Though the Gonds (divided between the Koya and Dorla tribes) are by far the biggest majority, there are small settlements of other tribal communities too. The non-adivasi communities, traders and settlers, live on the edges of the forest, near the roads and markets.

 The PWG were not the first evangelicals to arrive in Dandakaranya. Baba Amte, the well-known Gandhian, had opened his ashram and leprosy hospital in Warora in 1975. The Ramakrishna Mission had begun opening village schools in the remote forests of Abujhmad. In north Bastar, Baba Bihari Das had started an aggressive drive to “bring tribals back into the Hindu fold”, which involved a campaign to denigrate tribal culture, induce self-hatred, and introduce Hinduism’s great gift—caste. The first converts, the village chiefs and big landlords—people like Mahendra Karma, founder of the Salwa Judum—were conferred the status of Dwij, twice-born, Brahmins. (Of course, this was a bit of a scam, because nobody can become a Brahmin. If they could, we’d be a nation of Brahmins by now.) But this counterfeit Hinduism is considered good enough for tribal people, just like the counterfeit brands of everything else—biscuits, soap, matches, oil—that are sold in village markets. As part of the Hindutva drive, the names of villages were changed in land records, as a result of which most have two names now, people’s names and government names. Innar village, for example, became Chinnari. On voters’ lists, tribal names were changed to Hindu names. (Massa Karma became Mahendra Karma.) Those who did not come forward to join the Hindu fold were declared ‘Katwas’ (by which they meant untouchables) who later became the natural constituency for the Maoists.




  
 
  

 These Maoists and Maoist Gonds don’t pay attention to things like state boundaries. They have different maps in their heads, their own paths.  

  
 
  
 

The PWG first began work in south Bastar and Gadchiroli. Comrade Venu describes those first months in some detail: how the villagers were suspicious of them, and wouldn’t let them into their homes. No one would offer them food or water. The police spread rumours that they were thieves. The women hid their jewellery in the ashes of their wood stoves. There was an enormous amount of repression. In November 1980, in Gadchiroli, the police opened fire at a village meeting and killed an entire squad. That was DK’s first ‘encounter’ killing. It was a traumatic setback, and the comrades retreated across the Godavari and returned to Adilabad but in 1981 they returned. They began to organise tribal people to demand a rise in the price they were being paid for tendu leaves (which are used to make beedis). At the time, traders paid three paise for a bundle of about 50 leaves. It was a formidable job to organise people entirely unfamiliar with this kind of politics, to lead them on strike. Eventually the strike was successful and the price was doubled, to six paise a bundle. But the real success for the party was to have been able to demonstrate the value of unity and a new way of conducting a political negotiation. Today, after several strikes and agitations, the price of a bundle of tendu leaves is Re 1. (It seems a little improbable at these rates, but the turnover of the tendu business runs into hundreds of crores of rupees.) Every season, the government floats tenders and gives contractors permission to extract a fixed volume of tendu leaves—usually between 1,500 and 5,000 standard bags known as manak boras. Each manak bora contains about 1,000 bundles. (Of course, there’s no way of ensuring that the contractors don’t extract more than they’re meant to.) By the time the tendu enters the market, it is sold in kilos. The slippery arithmetic and the sly system of measurement that converts bundles into manak boras into kilos is controlled by the contractors, and leaves plenty of room for manipulation of the worst kind. The most conservative estimate puts their profit per standard bag at about Rs 1,100. (That’s after paying the party a commission of Rs 120 per bag.) Even by that gauge, a small contractor (1,500 bags) makes about Rs 16 lakh a season and a big one (5,000 bags) upto Rs 55 lakh. A more realistic estimate would be several times this amount. Meanwhile, the Gravest Internal Security Threat makes just enough to stay alive until the next season.


Gathered Storm: Dance troupes of various Janatana Sarkars perform on Bhumkal Day

We’re interrupted by some laughter and the sight of Nilesh, one of the young PLGA comrades, walking rapidly towards the cooking area, slapping himself. When he comes closer, I see that he’s carrying a leafy nest of angry red ants that have crawled all over him and are biting him on his arms and neck. Nilesh is laughing too. “Have you ever eaten ant chutney?” Comrade Venu asks me. I know red ants well, from my childhood in Kerala, I’ve been bitten by them, but I’ve never eaten them. (The chapoli turns out to be nice. Sour. Lots of folic acid.)

 Nilesh is from Bijapur, which is at the heart of Salwa Judum operations. Nilesh’s younger brother joined the Judum on one of its looting and burning sprees and was made a Special Police Officer (SPO). He lives in the Basaguda camp with his mother. His father refused to go and stayed behind in the village. In effect, it’s a family blood feud. Later on, when I had an opportunity to talk to him, I asked Nilesh why his brother had done that. “He was very young,” Nilesh said, “he got an opportunity to run wild and hurt people and burn houses. He went crazy, did terrible things. Now he is stuck. He can never come back to the village. He will not be forgiven. He knows that.”

We return to the history lesson. The party’s next big struggle, Comrade Venu says, was against the Ballarpur Paper Mills. The government had given the Thapars a 45-year contract to extract 1.5 lakh tonnes of bamboo at a hugely subsidised rate. (Small beer compared to bauxite, but still.) The tribals were paid 10 paise for a bundle which contained 20 culms of bamboo. (I won’t yield to the vulgar temptation of comparing that with the profits the Thapars were making.) A long agitation, a strike, followed by negotiations with officials of the paper mill in the presence of the people, tripled the price to 30 paise per bundle. For the tribal people, these were huge achievements. Other political parties had made promises, but showed no signs of keeping them. People began to approach the PWG asking if they could join up.

 But the politics of tendu, bamboo and other forest produce was seasonal. The perennial problem, the real bane of people’s lives, was the biggest landlord of all, the Forest Department. Every morning, forest officials, even the most junior of them, would appear in villages like a bad dream, preventing people from ploughing their fields, collecting firewood, plucking leaves, picking fruit, grazing their cattle, from living. They brought elephants to overrun fields and scattered babool seeds to destroy the soil as they passed by. People would be beaten, arrested, humiliated, their crops destroyed. Of course, from the forest department’s point of view, these were illegal people engaged in unconstitutional activity, and the department was only implementing the Rule of Law. (Their sexual exploitation of women was just an added perk in a hardship posting.)

 Emboldened by the people’s participation in these struggles, the party decided to confront the forest department. It encouraged people to take over forest land and cultivate it. The forest department retaliated by burning new villages that came up in forest areas. In 1986, it announced a National Park in Bijapur, which meant the eviction of 60 villages. More than half of them had already been moved out, and construction of national park infrastructure had begun when the party moved in. It demolished the construction and stopped the eviction of the remaining villages. It prevented the forest department from entering the area. On a few occasions, officials were captured, tied to trees and beaten by villagers. It was cathartic revenge for generations of exploitation. Eventually, the forest department fled. Between 1986 and 2000, the party redistributed 3,00,000 acres of forest land. Today, Comrade Venu says, there are no landless peasants in Dandakaranya.

 For today’s generation of young people, the forest department is a distant memory, the stuff of stories mothers tell their children, about a mythological past of bondage and humiliation. For the older generation, freedom from the forest department meant genuine freedom. They could touch it, taste it. It meant far more than India’s Independence ever did. They began to rally to the party that had struggled with them.

The seven-squad team had come a long way. Its influence now ranged across a 60,000 sq km stretch of forest, thousands of villages and millions of people.

 But the departure of the forest department heralded the arrival of the police. That set off a cycle of bloodshed. Fake ‘encounters’ by the police, ambushes by the PWG. With the redistribution of land came other responsibilities: irrigation, agricultural productivity and the problem of an expanding population arbitrarily clearing forest land. A decision was taken to separate ‘mass work’ and ‘military work’.

Today, Dandakaranya is administered by an elaborate structure of Janatana Sarkars (people’s governments). The organising principles came from the Chinese revolution and the Vietnam war. Each Janatana Sarkar is elected by a cluster of villages whose combined population can range from 500 to 5,000. It has nine departments: Krishi (agriculture), Vyapar-Udyog (trade and industry) Arthik (economic), Nyay (justice), Raksha (defence), Hospital (health), Jan Sampark (public relations), School-Riti Rivaj (education and culture), and Jungle. A group of Janatana Sarkars come under an Area Committee. Three area committees make up a Division. There are 10 divisions in Dandakaranya.

“We have a Save the Jungle department now,” Comrade Venu says. “You must have read the government report that says forest has increased in Naxal areas?”




  
 
  

 You’ve to be born a Brahmin, you can’t become one. But counterfeit Hinduism is good enough for tribals, like the counterfeit brands here.  

  
 
  
 

Ironically, Comrade Venu says, the first people to benefit from the party’s campaign against the forest department were the mukhias (village chiefs)—the Dwij brigade. They used their manpower and their resources to grab as much land as they could while the going was good. But then people began to approach the party with their “internal contradictions”, as Comrade Venu put it quaintly. The party began to turn its attention to issues of equity, class and injustice within tribal society. The big landlords sensed trouble on the horizon. As the party’s influence expanded, theirs had begun to wane. Increasingly, people were taking their problems to the party instead of to the mukhias. Old forms of exploitation began to be challenged. On the day of the first rain, people were traditionally supposed to till the mukhia’s land instead of their own. That stopped. They no longer offered them the first day’s picking of mahua or other forest produce. Obviously, something needed to be done.

 Enter Mahendra Karma, one of the biggest landlords in the region and at the time a member of the Communist Party of India (CPI). In 1990, he rallied a group of mukhias and landlords and started a campaign called the Jan Jagran Abhiyaan (public awakening campaign). Their way of ‘awakening’ the ‘public’ was to form a hunting party of about 300 men to comb the forest, killing people, burning houses and molesting women. The then Madhya Pradesh government—Chhattisgarh had not yet been created—provided police back-up. In Maharashtra, something similar called ‘Democratic Front’ began its assault. People’s War responded to all of this in true People’s War style, by killing a few of the most notorious landlords. In a few months, the Jan Jagran Abhiyaan, the ‘white terror’—Comrade Venu’s term for it—faded. In 1998, Mahendra Karma, who had by now joined the Congress party, tried to revive the Jan Jagran Abhiyaan. This time it fizzled out even faster than before.


Armed Strugglers: A village militia, the ‘base force’ of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army

Then, in the summer of 2005, fortune favoured him. In April, the BJP government in Chhattisgarh signed two MoUs to set up integrated steel plants (the terms of which are secret). One for Rs 7,000 crore with Essar Steel in Bailadila, and the other for Rs 10,000 crore with Tata Steel in Lohandiguda. That same month, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made his famous statement about the Maoists being the “Gravest Internal Security Threat” to India. (It was an odd thing to say at the time, because actually the opposite was true. The Congress government in Andhra Pradesh had just outmanoeuvred the Maoists, decimated them. They had lost about 1,600 of their cadre and were in complete disarray.) The PM’s statement sent the share value of mining companies soaring. It also sent a signal to the media that the Maoists were fair game for anyone who chose to go after them. In June 2005, Mahendra Karma called a secret meeting of mukhias in Kutroo village and announced the Salwa Judum (the Purification Hunt). A lovely melange of tribal earthiness and Dwij/Nazi sentiment.

 Unlike the Jan Jagran Abhiyaan, the Salwa Judum was a ground-clearing operation, meant to move people out of their villages into roadside camps, where they could be policed and controlled. In military terms, it’s called Strategic Hamleting. It was devised by General Sir Harold Briggs in 1950 when the British were at war against the communists in Malaya. The Briggs Plan became very popular with the Indian army, which has used it in Nagaland, Mizoram and in Telangana. The BJP chief minister of Chhattisgarh, Raman Singh, announced that as far as his government was concerned, villagers who did not move into the camps would be considered Maoists. So, in Bastar, for an ordinary villager, just staying at home became the equivalent of indulging in dangerous terrorist activity.

 Along with a steel mug of black tea, as a special treat, someone hands me a pair of earphones and switches on a little MP3 player. It’s a scratchy recording of Mr Manhar, the then SP Bijapur, briefing a junior officer over the wireless about the rewards and incentives the state and central governments are offering to ‘jagrit’ (awakened) villages, and to people who agree to move into camps. He then gives clear instructions that villages that refuse to surrender should be burnt and journalists who want to ‘cover’ Naxalites should be shot on sight. (I’d read about this in the papers long ago. When the story broke, as punishment—it’s not clear to whom—the SP was transferred to the State Human Rights Commission.)

 The first village the Salwa Judum burnt (on June 18, 2005) was Ambeli. Between June and December 2005, it burned, killed, raped and looted its way through hundreds of villages of south Dantewada. The centre of its operations were the districts of Bijapur and Bhairamgarh, near Bailadila, where Essar Steel’s new plant was proposed. Not coincidentally, these were also Maoist strongholds, where the Janatana Sarkars had done a great deal of work, especially in building water-harvesting structures. The Janatana Sarkars became the special target of the Salwa Judum’s attacks. Hundreds of people were killed in the most brutal ways. About 60,000 people moved into camps, some voluntarily, others out of terror. Of these, about 3,000 were appointed SPOs on a salary of Rs 1,500.

 For these paltry crumbs, young people, like Nilesh’s brother, have sentenced themselves to a life-sentence in a barbed wire enclosure. Cruel as they have been, they could end up being the worst victims of this horrible war. No Supreme Court judgement ordering the Salwa Judum to be dismantled can change their fate.

 The remaining hundreds of thousands of people went off the government radar. (But the development funds for these 644 villages did not. What happens to that little goldmine?) Many of them made their way to Andhra Pradesh and Orissa where they usually migrated to work as contract labour during the chilli-picking season. But tens of thousands fled into the forest, where they still remain, living without shelter, coming back to their fields and homes only in the daytime.

 In the slipstream of the Salwa Judum, a swarm of police stations and camps appeared. The idea was to provide carpet security for a ‘creeping reoccupation’ of Maoist-controlled territory. The assumption was that the Maoists would not dare to attack such a large concentration of security forces. The Maoists, for their part, realised that if they did not break that carpet security, it would amount to abandoning people whose trust they had earned, and with whom they had lived and worked for 25 years. They struck back in a series of attacks on the heart of the security grid.


On January 26, 2006, the PLGA attacked the Gangalaur police camp and killed seven people. On July 17, 2006, the Salwa Judum camp at Erabor was attacked, 20 people were killed and 150 injured. (You might have read about it: “Maoists attacked the relief camp set up by the state government to provide shelter to the villagers who had fled from their villages because of terror unleashed by the Naxalites.”) On December 13, 2006, they attacked the Basaguda ‘relief’ camp and killed three SPOs and a constable. On March 15, 2007, came the most audacious of them all. One hundred and twenty PLGA guerrillas attacked the Rani Bodili Kanya Ashram, a girls’ hostel that had been converted into a barrack for 80 Chhattisgarh Police (and SPOs) while the girls still lived in it as human shields. The PLGA entered the compound, cordoned off the annexe in which the girls lived, and attacked the barracks. Some 55 policemen and SPOs were killed. None of the girls was hurt. (The candid SP of Dantewada had shown me his PowerPoint presentation with horrifying photographs of the burned, disembowelled bodies of the policemen amidst the ruins of the blown-up school building. They were so macabre, it was impossible not to look away. He looked pleased at my reaction.)

 The attack on Rani Bodili caused an uproar in the country. Human rights organisations condemned the Maoists not just for their violence, but also for being anti-education and attacking schools. But in Dandakaranya, the Rani Bodili attack became a legend: songs, poems and plays were written about it.




  
 
  

 We shouldn’t judge Charu Mazumdar too harshly. Especially not while we swaddle ourselves with Gandhi’s pious humbug.  

  
 
  
 

The Maoist counter-offensive did break the carpet security and gave people breathing space. The police and the Salwa Judum retreated into their camps, from which they now emerge—usually in the dead of night—only in packs of 300 or 1,000 to carry out cordon and search operations in villages. Gradually, except for the SPOs and their families, the rest of the people in the Salwa Judum camps began to return to their villages. The Maoists welcomed them back and announced that even SPOs could return if they genuinely, and publicly, regretted their actions. Young people began to flock to the PLGA. (The PLGA had been formally constituted in December 2000. Over the last 30 years, its armed squads had very gradually expanded into sections, sections had grown into platoons, and platoons into companies. But after the Salwa Judum’s depredations, the PLGA was rapidly able to declare battalion strength.)

 The Salwa Judum had not just failed, it had backfired badly.

 As we now know, it was not just a local operation by a small-time hood. Regardless of the doublespeak in the press, the Salwa Judum was a joint operation by the state government of Chhattisgarh and the Congress party which was in power at the Centre. It could not be allowed to fail. Not when all those MoUs were still waiting, like wilting hopefuls on the marriage market. The government was under tremendous pressure to come up with a new plan. They came up with Operation Green Hunt. The Salwa Judum SPOs are called Koya Commandos now. It has deployed the Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF), the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Border Security Force (BSF), the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Greyhounds, Scorpions, Cobras. And a policy that’s affectionately called WHAM—Winning Hearts and Minds.




  
 
  

 Lohandiguda was never a Naxal area. The comrades moved in when graffiti saying ‘Naxali aao, hamein bachao’ began appearing on walls.  

  
 
  
 

Significant wars are often fought in unlikely places. Free Market Capitalism defeated Soviet Communism in the bleak mountains of Afghanistan. Here in the forests of Dantewada, a battle rages for the soul of India. Plenty has been said about the deepening crisis in Indian democracy and the collusion between big corporations, major political parties and the security establishment. If anybody wants to do a quick spot check, Dantewada is the place to go.

 A draft report on State Agrarian Relations and the Unfinished Task of Land Reform (Volume 1) said that Tata Steel and Essar Steel were the first financiers of the Salwa Judum. Because it was a government report, it created a flurry when it was reported in the press. (That fact has subsequently been dropped from the final report. Was it a genuine error, or did someone receive a gentle, integrated steel tap on the shoulder?)

 On October 12, 2009, the mandatory public hearing for Tata’s steel plant, meant to be held in Lohandiguda where local people could come, actually took place in a small hall inside the Collectorate in Jagdalpur, many miles away, cordoned off with massive security. A hired audience of 50 tribals was brought in a guarded convoy of government jeeps. After the meeting, the district collector congratulated ‘the people of Lohandiguda’ for their cooperation. The local newspapers reported the lie, even though they knew better. (The advertisements rolled in.) Despite villagers’ objections, land acquisition for the project has begun.

 The Maoists are not the only ones who seek to depose the Indian State. It’s already been deposed several times by Hindu fundamentalism and economic totalitarianism.




  
 
  

 In true colonial fashion, they send Nagas and Mizos to fight in Chhattisgarh, the Sikhs to Kashmir, and the Tamilians to Assam.  

  
 
  
 

Lohandiguda, a five-hour drive from Dantewada, never used to be a Naxalite area. But it is now. Comrade Joori, who sat next to me while I ate the ant chutney, works in the area. She said they decided to move in after graffiti had begun to appear on the walls of village houses, saying, Naxali aao, hamein bachao (Naxals come and save us)! A few months ago, Vimal Meshram, president of the village panchayat, was shot dead in the market. “He was Tata’s man,” Joori says. “He was forcing people to give up their land and accept compensation. It’s good that he’s been finished. We lost a comrade too. They shot him. D’you want more chapoli?” She’s only 20. “We won’t let the Tatas come there. People don’t want them.” Joori is not PLGA. She’s in the Chetna Natya Manch (CNM), the cultural wing of the party. She sings. She writes songs. She’s from Abujhmad. (She’s married to Comrade Madhav. She fell in love with his singing when he visited her village with a CNM troupe.)

 I feel I ought to say something at this point. About the futility of violence, about the unacceptability of summary executions. But what should I suggest they do? Go to court? Do a dharna at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi? A rally? A relay hunger strike? It sounds ridiculous. The promoters of the New Economic Policy—who find it so easy to say “There Is No Alternative”—should be asked to suggest an alternative Resistance Policy. A specific one, to these specific people, in this specific forest. Here. Now. Which party should they vote for? Which democratic institution in this country should they approach? Which door did the Narmada Bachao Andolan not knock on during the years and years it fought against Big Dams on the Narmada?

It’s dark. There’s a lot of activity in the camp, but I can’t see anything. Just points of light moving around. It’s hard to tell whether they are stars or fireflies or Maoists on the move. Little Mangtu appears from nowhere. I found out that he’s part of the first batch of the Young Communists Mobile School, who are being taught to read and write and tutored in basic Communist principles. (“Indoctrination of young minds!” our corporate media howls. The TV advertisements that brainwash children before they can even think are not seen as a form of indoctrination.) The young Communists are not allowed to carry guns or wear uniforms. But they trail the PLGA squads, with stars in their eyes, like groupies of a rock band.

 Mangtu has adopted me with a gently proprietorial air. He has filled my water bottle and says I should pack my bag. A whistle blows. The blue jhilli tent is dismantled and folded up in five minutes flat. Another whistle and all hundred comrades fall in line. Five rows. Comrade Raju is the Director of Ops. There’s a roll call. I’m in the line too, shouting out my number when Comrade Kamla who is in front of me, prompts me. (We count to twenty and then start from one, because that’s as far as most Gonds count. Twenty is enough for them. Maybe it should be enough for us too.) Chandu is in fatigues now, and carries a sten gun. In a low voice, Comrade Raju is briefing the group. It’s all in Gondi, I don’t understand a thing, but I keep hearing the word RV. Later Raju tells me it stands for Rendezvous! It’s a Gondi word now. “We make RV points so that in case we come under fire and people have to scatter, they know where to regroup.” He cannot possibly know the kind of panic this induces in me. Not because I’m scared of being fired on, but because I’m scared of being lost. I’m a directional dyslexic, capable of getting lost between my bedroom and my bathroom. What will I do in 60,000 square kilometres of forest? Come hell or high water, I’m going to be holding on to Comrade Raju’s pallu.




  
 
  

 Dandakaranya was full of people who had many names, fluid identities. It was balm to me, the idea. Not to be stuck with yourself, be someone else.  

  
 
  
 

Before we start walking, Comrade Venu comes up to me: “Okaythen comrade. I’ll take your leave.” I’m taken aback. He looks like a little mosquito in a woollen cap and chappals, surrounded by his guards, three women, three men. Heavily armed. “We are very grateful to you comrade, for coming all the way here,” he says. Once again the handshake, the clenched fist. “Lal Salaam Comrade.” He disappears into the forest, the Keeper of the Keys. And in a moment, it’s as though he was never here. I’m a little bereft. But I have hours of recordings to listen to. And as the days turn into weeks, I will meet many people who paint colour and detail into the grid he drew for me. We begin to walk in the opposite direction. Comrade Raju, smelling of Iodex from a mile off, says with a happy smile, “My knees are gone. I can only walk if I have had a fistful of painkillers.”

Comrade Raju speaks perfect Hindi and has a deadpan way of telling the funniest stories. He worked as an advocate in Raipur for 18 years. Both he and his wife Malti were party members and part of its city network. At the end of 2007, one of the key people in the Raipur network was arrested, tortured and eventually turned informer. He was driven around Raipur in a closed police vehicle and made to point out his former colleagues. Comrade Malti was one of them. On January 22, 2008, she was arrested along with several others. The charge against her is that she mailed CDs containing video evidence of Salwa Judum atrocities to several members of Parliament. Her case rarely comes up for hearing because the police know their case is flimsy. But the new Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act (CSPSA) allows the police to hold her without bail for several years. “Now the government has deployed several battalions of Chhattisgarh police to protect the poor members of Parliament from their own mail,” Comrade Raju says. He did not get caught because he was in Dandakaranya at the time, attending a meeting. He’s been here ever since. His two schoolgoing children, who were left alone at home, were interrogated extensively by the police. Finally, their home was packed up and they went to live with an uncle. Comrade Raju received news of them for the first time only a few weeks ago. What gives him this strength, this ability to hold on to his acid humour? What keeps them all going, despite all they have endured? Their faith and hope—and love—for the Party. I encounter it again and again, in the deepest, most personal ways.




  
 
  

 This army is more Gandhian than any Gandhian, even in sabotage. Before burning a police vehicle, it’s stripped down, the parts cannibalised.  

  
 
  
 

We’re moving in single file now. Myself and one hundred “senselessly violent”, bloodthirsty insurgents. I looked around at the camp before we left. There are no signs that almost a hundred people had camped here, except for some ash where the fires had been. I cannot believe this army. As far as consumption goes, it’s more Gandhian than any Gandhian, and has a lighter carbon footprint than any climate change evangelist. But for now, it even has a Gandhian approach to sabotage; before a police vehicle is burnt, for example, it is stripped down and every part cannibalised. The steering wheel is straightened out and made into a bharmaar, the rexine upholstery stripped and used for ammunition pouches, the battery for solar charging. (The new instructions from the high command are that captured vehicles should be buried and not cremated. So they can be resurrected when needed.) Should I write a play, I wonder—Gandhi Get Your Gun? Or will I be lynched?

 We’re walking in pitch darkness and dead silence. I’m the only one using a torch, pointed down so that all I can see in its circle of light are Comrade Kamla’s bare heels in her scuffed, black chappals, showing me exactly where to put my feet. She is carrying 10 times more weight than I am. Her backpack, her rifle, a huge bag of provisions on her head, one of the large cooking pots and two shoulder bags full of vegetables. The bag on her head is perfectly balanced, and she can scramble down slopes and slippery rock pathways without so much as touching it. She is a miracle. It turns out to be a long walk. I’m grateful to the history lesson because apart from everything else it gave my feet a rest for a whole day. It’s the most beautiful thing, walking in the forest at night.

 And I’ll be doing it night after night.


We’re going to a celebration of the centenary of the 1910 Bhumkal rebellion in which the Koyas rose up against the British. Bhumkal means earthquake. Comrade Raju says people will walk for days together to come for the celebration. The forest must be full of people on the move. There are celebrations in all the DK divisions. We are privileged because Comrade Leng, the Master of Ceremonies, is walking with us. In Gondi, Leng means ‘the voice’. Comrade Leng is a tall, middle-aged man from Andhra Pradesh, a colleague of the legendary and beloved singer-poet Gadar, who founded the radical cultural organisation Jan Natya Manch (JNM) in 1972. Eventually, JNM became a formal part of the PWG and in Andhra Pradesh could draw audiences numbering in the tens of thousands. Comrade Leng joined in 1977 and became a famous singer in his own right. He lived in Andhra through the worst repression, the era of ‘encounter’ killings in which friends died almost every day. He himself was picked up one night from his hospital bed, by a woman Superintendent of Police masquerading as a doctor. He was taken to the forest outside Warangal to be ‘encountered’. But luckily, Gadar got the news and managed to raise an alarm. When the PW decided to start a cultural organisation in DK in 1998, Comrade Leng was sent to head the Chetna Natya Manch. And here he is now, walking with me, for some reason wearing an olive-green shirt and purple pyjamas with pink bunnies on them. “There are 10,000 members in cnm now,” he told me. “We have 500 songs, in Hindi, Gondi, Chhattisgarhi and Halbi. We have printed a book with 140 of our songs. Everybody writes songs.” The first time I spoke to him, he sounded very grave, very single-minded. But days later, sitting around a fire, still in those pyjamas, he tells us about a very successful, mainstream Telugu film director (a friend of his) who always plays a Naxalite in his own films. “I asked him,” Comrade Leng said in his lovely Telugu-accented Hindi, “why do you think Naxalites are always like this?”—and he did a deft caricature of a crouched, high-stepping, hunted-looking man emerging from the forest with an AK-47, and left us screaming with laughter.




  
 
  

 Happiness is taken seriously in Dandakaranya. People walk for miles, for days, to sing and dance together. This is their defiance.  

  
 
  
 

I’m not sure whether I’m looking forward to the Bhumkal celebrations. I fear I’ll see traditional tribal dances stiffened by Maoist propaganda, rousing, rhetorical speeches and an obedient audience with glazed eyes. We arrive at the grounds quite late in the evening. A temporary monument, of bamboo scaffolding wrapped in red cloth, has been erected. On top, above the hammer and sickle of the Maoist Party, is the bow and arrow of the Janatana Sarkar, wrapped in silver foil. Appropriate, the hierarchy. The stage is huge, also temporary, on a sturdy scaffolding covered by a thick layer of mud plaster. Already, there are small fires scattered around the ground, people have begun to arrive and are cooking their evening meal. They’re only silhouettes in the dark. We thread our way through them (lalsalaam, lalsalaam, lalsalaam) and keep going for about 15 minutes until we re-enter the forest.

 At our new campsite, we have to fall-in again. Another roll call. And then instructions about sentry positions and ‘firing arcs’—decisions about who will cover which area in the event of a police attack. RV points are fixed again.


Boy, What A Smile: Comrade Kamla, 17, wearing a pistol on her hip. Also, a miracle.

An advance party has arrived and cooked dinner already. For dessert, Kamla brings me a wild guava that she has plucked on the walk and squirrelled away for me.

 From dawn, there is the sense of more and more people gathering for the day’s celebration. There’s a buzz of excitement building up. People who haven’t seen each other in a long time meet again. We can hear the sound of mikes being tested. Flags, banners, posters, buntings are going up. A poster with the pictures of the five people who were killed in Ongnaar the day we arrived has appeared.

 I’m drinking tea with Comrade Narmada, Comrade Maase and Comrade Rupi. Comrade Narmada talks about the many years she worked in Gadchiroli before becoming the DK head of the Krantikari Adivasi Mahila Sangathan. Rupi and Maase have been urban activists in Andhra Pradesh and tell me about the long years of struggle by women within the party, not just for their rights, but also to make the party see that equality between men and women is seen as central to a dream of a just society. We talk about the ’70s and the stories of women within the Naxalite movement who were disillusioned by male comrades who thought themselves great revolutionaries but were hobbled by the same old patriarchy, the same old chauvinism. Maase says things have changed a lot since then, though they still have a way to go. (The party’s central committee and politburo have no women yet.)

 Around noon, another PLGA contingent arrives. This one is headed by a tall, lithe, boyish-looking man. This comrade has two names—Sukhdev, and Gudsa Usendi—neither of them his. Sukhdev is the name of a very beloved comrade who was martyred. (In this war, only the dead are safe enough to use their real names.) As for Gudsa Usendi, many comrades have been Gudsa Usendi at one point or another. (A few months ago, it was Comrade Raju.) Gudsa Usendi is the name of the party’s spokesperson for Dandakaranya. So even though Sukhdev spends the rest of the trip with me, I have no idea how I’d ever find him again. I’d recognise his laugh anywhere though. He came to DK in ’88, he says, when the PWG decided to send one-third of its forces from north Telangana into DK. He’s nicely dressed, in ‘civil’ (Gondi for ‘civilian clothes’) as opposed to ‘dress’ (the Maoist ‘uniform’) and could pass off as a young executive. I ask him why no uniform. He says he’s been travelling and has just come back from the Keshkal ghats near Kanker. There are reports of 3 million tonnes of bauxite that a company called Vedanta has its eye on.

 Bingo. Ten on ten for my instincts.

 Sukhdev says he went there to measure the people’s temperature. To see if they were prepared to fight. “They want squads now. And guns.” He throws his head back and roars with laughter, “I told them it’s not so easy, bhai.” From the stray wisps of conversation and the ease with which he carries his AK-47, I can tell he’s also high up and hands-on PLGA.

Jungle post arrives. There’s a biscuit for me! It’s from Comrade Venu. On a tiny piece of paper, folded and refolded, he has written down the lyrics of a song he promised he would send me. Comrade Narmada smiles when she reads them. She knows this story. It goes back to the ’80s, around the time when people first began to trust the party and come to it with their problems—their ‘inner contradictions’, as Comrade Venu put it. Women were among the first to come. One evening an old lady sitting by the fire got up and sang a song for the dada log. She was a Maadiya, among whom it was customary for women to remove their blouses and remain bare-breasted after they were married.


Jumper polo intor Dada, Dakoniley
 Taane tasom intor Dada, Dakoniley
 Bata papam kittom Dada, Dakoniley
 Duniya kadile maata Dada, Dakoniley

 (They say we cannot keep our
 blouses, Dada, Dakoniley
 They make us take them off, Dada,
 In what way have we sinned, Dada,
 The world’s changed, has it not Dada)

 Aatum hatteke Dada, Dakoniley
 Aada nanga dantom Dada, Dakoniley
 Id pisval manni Dada, Dakoniley
 Mava koyaturku vehat Dada, Dakoniley

 (But when we go to market Dada,
 We have to go half-naked Dada,
 We don’t want this life Dada,
 Tell our ancestors this Dada).

This was the first women’s issue the party decided to campaign against. It had to be handled delicately, with surgical tools. In 1986, it set up the Adivasi Mahila Sangathan (AMS) which evolved into the Krantikari Adivasi Mahila Sangathan and now has 90,000 enrolled members. It could well be the largest women’s organisation in the country. (They’re all Maoists by the way, all 90,000 of them. Are they going to be ‘wiped out’? And what about the 10,000 members of CNM? Them too?) KAMS campaigns against the adivasi traditions of forced marriage and abduction. Against the custom of making menstruating women live outside the village in a hut in the forest. Against bigamy and domestic violence. It hasn’t won all its battles, but then which feminists have? For instance, in Dandakaranya, even today women are not allowed to sow seeds. In party meetings, men agree that this is unfair and ought to be done away with. But, in practice, they simply don’t allow it. So, the party decided that women would sow seeds on common land which belongs to the Janatana Sarkar. On that land, they sow seed, grow vegetables and build check dams. A half-victory, not a whole one.




  
 
  

 In most jan adalats, at least the collective is physically present to make a decision. It’s not made by judges who’ve lost touch with ordinary life.  

  
 
  
 

As police repression has grown in Bastar, the women of KAMS have become a formidable force and rally in their hundreds, sometimes thousands, to physically confront the police. The very fact that KAMS exists has radically changed traditional attitudes and eased many of the traditional forms of discrimination against women. For many young women, joining the party, in particular the PLGA, became a way of escaping the suffocation of their own society. Comrade Sushila, a senior office-bearer of KAMS talks about the Salwa Judum’s rage against KAMS women. She says one of their slogans was Hum do bibi layenge! Layenge! (We will have two wives! We will!). A lot of the rape and bestial sexual mutilation was directed at members of KAMS. Many young women who witnessed the savagery then joined the PLGA and now women make up 45 per cent of its cadre. Comrade Narmada sends for some of them and they join us in a while.

 Comrade Rinki has very short hair. A bob-cut, as they say in Gondi. It’s brave of her, because here, ‘bob-cut’ means ‘Maoist’. For the police, that’s more than enough evidence to warrant summary execution. Comrade Rinki’s village, Korma, was attacked by the Naga battalion and the Salwa Judum in 2005. At that time, Rinki was part of the village militia. So were her friends Lukki and Sukki, who were also members of KAMS. After burning the village, the Naga battalion caught Lukki and Sukki and one other girl, gang-raped and killed them. “They raped them on the grass,” Rinki says, “but after it was over, there was no grass left.” It’s been years now, the Naga battalion has gone, but the police still come. “They come whenever they need women, or chickens.”


Rest Station: A Maoist ‘camp’. When they move, all that will remain is the ash from the kitchen fire.

Ajitha has a bob-cut too. The Judum came to Korseel, her village, and killed three people by drowning them in a nallah. Ajitha was with the militia and followed the Judum at a distance to a place close to the village called Paral Nar Todak. She watched them rape six women and shoot a man in his throat.

 Comrade Laxmi, who is a beautiful girl with a long plait, tells me she watched the Judum burn 30 houses in her village, Jojor. “We had no weapons then,” she says, “we could do nothing but watch.” She joined the PLGA soon after. Laxmi was one of the 150 guerrillas who walked through the jungle for three-and-a-half months in 2008, to Nayagarh in Orissa, to raid a police armoury from where they captured 1,200 rifles and 2,00,000 rounds of ammunition.

 Comrade Sumitra joined the PLGA in 2004, before the Salwa Judum began its rampage. She joined, she says, because she wanted to escape from home. “Women are controlled in every way,” she told me. “In our village, girls were not allowed to climb trees; if they did, they would have to pay a fine of Rs 500 or a hen. If a man hits a woman and she hits him back she has to give the village a goat. Men go off to the hills for months together to hunt. Women are not allowed to go near the kill, the best part of the meat goes to men. Women are not allowed to eat eggs.” Good reason to join a guerrilla army?

 Sumitra tells the story of two of her friends, Telam Parvati and Kamla, who worked with KAMS. Telam Parvati was from Polekaya village in south Bastar. Like everyone else from there, she too watched the Salwa Judum burn her village. She then joined the PLGA and went to work in the Keshkal ghats. In 2009, she and Kamla had just finished organising the March 8 Women’s Day celebrations in the area. They were together in a little hut just outside a village called Vadgo. The police surrounded the hut at night and began to fire. Kamla fired back, but she was killed. Parvati escaped, but was found and killed the next day.

 That’s what happened last year on Women’s Day. And here’s a press report from a national newspaper about Women’s Day this year:


Bastar rebels bat for women’s rights
 Sahar Khan, Mail Today, Raipur, March 7, 2010

The government may have pulled out all stops to combat the Maoist menace in the country. But a section of rebels in Chhattisgarh has more pressing matters in hand than survival. With International Women’s Day around the corner, Maoists in the Bastar region of the state have called for week-long “celebrations” to advocate women’s rights. Posters were also put up in Bijapur, a part of Bastar district. The call by the self-styled champions of women’s rights has left the state police astonished. Inspector-general (IG) of Bastar, T.J. Longkumer said, “I have never seen such an appeal from the Naxalites, who believe only in violence and bloodshed.”

And then the report goes on to say:


“I think the Maoists are trying to counter our highly successful Jan Jagran Abhiyaan (mass awareness campaign). We started the ongoing campaign with an aim to win popular support for Operation Green Hunt, which was launched by the police to root out Left-wing extremists,” the IG said.

This cocktail of malice and ignorance is not unusual. Gudsa Usendi, chronicler of the party’s present, knows more about this than most people. His little computer and MP3 recorder are full of press statements, denials, corrections, party literature, lists of the dead, TV clips and audio and video material. “The worst thing about being Gudsa Usendi,” he says, “is issuing clarifications which are never published. We could bring out a thick book of our unpublished clarifications about the lies they tell about us.” He speaks without a trace of indignation, in fact, with some amusement.

“What’s the most ridiculous charge you’ve had to deny?”

He thinks back. “In 2007, we had to issue a statement saying, ‘Nahin bhai, hamne gai ko hathode se nahin mara (No brother, we did not kill the cows with a hammer).’ In 2007, the Raman Singh government announced a Gai Yojana (cow scheme), an election promise, a cow for every adivasi. One day the TV channels and newspapers reported that Naxalites had attacked a herd of cows and bludgeoned them to death—with hammers—because they were anti-Hindu, anti-BJP. You can imagine what happened. We issued a denial. Hardly anybody carried it. Later, it turned out that the man who had been given the cows to distribute was a rogue. He sold them and said we had ambushed him and killed the cows.”

And the most serious?

“Oh, there are dozens, they are running a campaign, after all. When the Salwa Judum started, the first day they attacked a village called Ambeli, burned it down and then all of them—SPOs, the Naga battalion, police—moved towards Kotrapal...you must have heard about Kotrapal? It’s a famous village, it has been burnt 22 times for refusing to surrender. When the Judum reached Kotrapal, our militia was waiting for it. They had prepared an ambush. Two SPOs died. We captured seven, the rest ran away. The next day the newspapers reported that the Naxalites had massacred poor adivasis. Some said we had killed hundreds. Even a respectable magazine like Frontline said we had killed 18 innocent adivasis. Even K. Balagopal, the human rights activist, who is usually meticulous about facts, even he said this. We sent a clarification. Nobody published it. Later, in his book, Balagopal acknowledged his mistake.... But who noticed?”


Remembering The Martyrs: Pictures of slain comrades displayed on Bhumkal Day

I asked what happened to the seven people who were captured. “The area committee called a jan adalat (people’s court). Four thousand people attended it. They listened to the whole story. Two of the SPOs were sentenced to death. Five were warned and let off. The people decided. Even with informers—which is becoming a huge problem nowadays—people listen to the case, the stories, the confessions and say, ‘Iska hum risk nahin le sakte (We’re not prepared to take the risk of trusting this person)’, or ‘Iska risk hum lenge (We are prepared to take the risk of trusting this person)’. The press always reports about informers who are killed. Never about the many who are let off. So everybody thinks it is some bloodthirsty procedure in which everybody is always killed. It’s not about revenge, it’s about survival and saving future lives.... Of course, there are problems, we’ve made terrible mistakes, we have even killed the wrong people in our ambushes thinking they were policemen, but it is not the way it’s portrayed in the media.”

The dreaded ‘People’s Courts’. How can we accept them? Or approve this form of rude justice?

 On the other hand, what about ‘encounters’, fake and otherwise—the worst form of summary justice—that get policemen and soldiers bravery medals, cash awards and out-of-turn promotions from the Indian government? The more they kill, the more they are rewarded. ‘Bravehearts’, they are called, the ‘Encounter Specialists’. ‘Anti-nationals’, we are called, those of us who dare to question them. And what about the Supreme Court that brazenly admitted it did not have enough evidence to sentence Mohammed Afzal (accused in the December 2001 Parliament attack) to death, but did so anyway, because “the collective conscience of the society will only be satisfied if capital punishment is awarded to the offender”.

At least in the case of the Kotrapal jan adalat, the collective was physically present to make its own decision. It wasn’t made by judges who had lost touch with ordinary life a long time ago, presuming to speak on behalf of an absent collective.

 What should the people of Kotrapal have done, I wonder? Sent for the police?


The sound of drums has become really loud. It’s Bhumkal time. We walk to the grounds. I can hardly believe my eyes. There is a sea of people, the most wild, beautiful people, dressed in the most wild, beautiful ways. The men seem to have paid much more attention to themselves than the women. They have feathered headgear and painted tattoos on their faces. Many have eye make-up and white, powdered faces. There’s lots of militia, girls in saris of breathtaking colours with rifles slung carelessly over their shoulders. There are old people, children, and red buntings arc across the sky. The sun is sharp and high. Comrade Leng speaks. And several office-holders of the various Janatana Sarkars. Comrade Niti, an extraordinary woman who has been with the party since 1997, is such a threat to the nation that in January 2007 more than 700 policemen surrounded Innar village because they heard she was there. Comrade Niti is considered to be so dangerous and is being hunted with such desperation not because she has led many ambushes (which she has), but because she is an adivasi woman who is loved by people in the village and is a real inspiration to young people. She speaks with her AK on her shoulder. (It’s a gun with a story. Almost everyone’s gun has a story: who it was snatched from, how, and by whom.)




  
 
  

 ‘Maoist-infested’. These are not careless words. Infest or infestation implies pests. Pests must be exterminated. Maoists must be wiped out.  

  
 
  
 

A CNM troupe performs a play about the Bhumkal uprising. The evil white colonisers wear hats and golden straw for hair, and bully and beat adivasis to pulp—causing endless delight in the audience. Another troupe from south Gangalaur performs a play called Nitir Judum Pito (Story of the Blood Hunt). Joori translates for me. It’s the story of two old people who go looking for their daughter’s village. As they walk through the forest, they get lost because everything is burnt and unrecognisable. The Salwa Judum has even burned the drums and the musical instruments. There are no ashes because it has been raining. They cannot find their daughter. In their sorrow, the old couple starts to sing, and hearing them, the voice of their daughter sings back to them from the ruins: the sound of our village has been silenced, she sings. There’s no more pounding of rice, no more laughter by the well. No more birds, no more bleating goats. The taut string of happiness has been snapped.

 Her father sings back: my beautiful daughter, don’t cry today. Everyone who is born must die. These trees around us will fall, flowers will bloom and fade, one day this world will grow old. But who are we dying for? One day our looters will learn, one day Truth will prevail, but our people will never forget you, not for thousands of years.

 A few more speeches. Then the drumming and the dancing begins. Each Janatana Sarkar has its own troupe. Each troupe has prepared its own dance. They arrive one by one, with huge drums and they dance wild stories. The only character every troupe has in common is Bad Mining Man, with a helmet and dark glasses, and usually smoking a cigarette. But there’s nothing stiff, or mechanical, about their dancing. As they dance, the dust rises. The sound of drums becomes deafening. Gradually, the crowd begins to sway. And then it begins to dance. They dance in little lines of six or seven, men and women separate, with their arms around each other’s waists. Thousands of people. This is what they’ve come for. For this. Happiness is taken very seriously here, in the Dandakaranya forest. People will walk for miles, for days together to feast and sing, to put feathers in their turbans and flowers in their hair, to put their arms around each other and drink mahua and dance through the night. No one sings or dances alone. This, more than anything else, signals their defiance towards a civilisation that seeks to annihilate them.

 I can’t believe all this is happening right under the noses of the police. Right in the midst of Operation Green Hunt.

 At first, the PLGA comrades watch the dancers, standing aside with their guns. But then, one by one, like ducks who cannot bear to stand on the shore and watch other ducks swim, they move in and begin to dance too. Soon there are lines of olive-green dancers, swirling with all the other colours. And then, as sisters and brothers and parents and children and friends who haven’t met for months, years sometimes, encounter each other, the lines break up and re-form and the olive green is distributed among the swirling saris and flowers and drums and turbans. It surely is a People’s Army. For now, at least. And what Chairman Mao said about the guerrillas being the fish and people being the water they swim in, is, at this moment, literally true.

 Chairman Mao. He’s here too. A little lonely, perhaps, but present. There’s a photograph of him, up on a red cloth screen. Marx too. And Charu Mazumdar, the founder and chief theoretician of the Naxalite Movement. His abrasive rhetoric fetishises violence, blood and martyrdom, and often employs a language so coarse as to be almost genocidal. Standing here, on Bhumkal day, I can’t help thinking that his analysis, so vital to the structure of this revolution, is so removed from its emotion and texture. When he said that only “an annihilation campaign” could produce “the new man who will defy death and be free from all thought of self-interest”—could he have imagined that this ancient people, dancing into the night, would be the ones on whose shoulders his dreams would come to rest?

It’s a great disservice to everything that is happening here that the only thing that seems to make it to the outside world is the stiff, unbending rhetoric of the ideologues of a party that has evolved from a problematic past. When Charu Mazumdar famously said, “China’s Chairman is our Chairman and China’s Path is Our Path,” he was prepared to extend it to the point where the Naxalites remained silent while General Yahya Khan committed genocide in East Pakistan (Bangladesh), because at the time, China was an ally of Pakistan. There was silence too, over the Khmer Rouge and its killing fields in Cambodia. There was silence over the egregious excesses of the Chinese and Russian revolutions. Silence over Tibet. Within the Naxalite movement too, there have been violent excesses and it’s impossible to defend much of what they’ve done. But can anything they have done compare with the sordid achievements of the Congress and the BJP in Punjab, Kashmir, Delhi, Mumbai, Gujarat.... And yet, despite these terrifying contradictions, Charu Mazumdar was a visionary in much of what he wrote and said. The party he founded (and its many splinter groups) has kept the dream of revolution real and present in India. Imagine a society without that dream. For that alone, we cannot judge him too harshly. Especially not while we swaddle ourselves with Gandhi’s pious humbug about the superiority of “the non-violent way” and his notion of trusteeship: “The rich man will be left in possession of his wealth, of which he will use what he reasonably requires for his personal needs and will act as a trustee for the remainder to be used for the good of society.”

How strange it is, though, that the contemporary tsars of the Indian Establishment—the State that crushed the Naxalites so mercilessly—should now be saying what Charu Mazumdar said so long ago: China’s Path is Our Path.

 Upside Down. Inside Out.


The Damned: Villagers from the submergence area of the proposed Bodhghat dam

China’s Path has changed. China has become an imperial power now, preying on other countries, other people’s resources. But the Party is still right, only, the Party has changed its mind.

 When the Party is a suitor (as it is now in Dandakaranya), wooing the people, attentive to their every need, then it genuinely is a People’s Party, its army genuinely a People’s Army. But after the Revolution how easily this love affair can turn into a bitter marriage. How easily the People’s Army can turn upon the people. Today in Dandakaranya, the Party wants to keep the bauxite in the mountain. Tomorrow, will it change its mind? But can we, should we let apprehensions about the future immobilise us in the present?




  
 
  

 How strange that the contemporary tsars of the Indian establishment now say what Charu Mazumdar said: China’s Path is Our Path.  

  
 
  
 

The dancing will go on all night. I walk back to the camp. Maase is there, awake. We chat late into the night. I give her my copy of Neruda’s Captain’s Verses (I brought it along, just in case). She asks, again and again, “What do they think of us outside? What do students say? Tell me about the women’s movement, what are the big issues now?” She asks about me, my writing. I try and give her an honest account of my chaos. Then she starts to talk about herself, how she joined the party. She tells me that her partner was killed last May, in a fake encounter. He was arrested in Nashik, and taken to Warangal to be killed. “They must have tortured him badly.” She was on her way to meet him when she heard he had been arrested. She’s been in the forest ever since. After a long silence, she tells me she was married once before, years ago. “He was killed in an encounter too,” she says, and adds with heart-breaking precision, “but in a real one.”

I lie awake on my jhilli, thinking of Maase’s protracted sadness, listening to the drums and the sounds of protracted happiness from the grounds, and thinking about Charu Mazumdar’s idea of protracted war, the central precept of the Maoist Party. This is what makes people think the Maoists’ offer to enter ‘peace talks’ is a hoax, a ploy to get breathing space to regroup, re-arm themselves and go back to waging protracted war. What is protracted war? Is it a terrible thing in itself, or does it depend on the nature of the war? What if the people here in Dandakaranya had not waged their protracted war for the last 30 years, where would they be now?

 And are the Maoists the only ones who believe in protracted war? Almost from the moment India became a sovereign nation, it turned into a colonial power, annexing territory, waging war. It has never hesitated to use military interventions to address political problems—Kashmir, Hyderabad, Goa, Nagaland, Manipur, Telangana, Assam, Punjab, the Naxalite uprising in West Bengal, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and now across the tribal areas of Central India. Tens of thousands have been killed with impunity, hundreds of thousands tortured. All of this behind the benign mask of democracy. Who have these wars been waged against? Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Communists, Dalits, Tribals and, most of all, against the poor who dare to question their lot instead of accepting the crumbs that are flung at them. It’s hard not to see that the Indian State is an essentially upper-caste Hindu State (regardless of the party in power) which harbours a reflexive hostility towards the ‘other’. One that, in true colonial fashion, sends the Nagas and Mizos to fight in Chhattisgarh, Sikhs to Kashmir, Kashmiris to Orissa, Tamilians to Assam and so on. If this isn’t protracted war, what is?

 Unpleasant thoughts on a beautiful, starry night. Sukhdev is smiling to himself, his face lit by his computer screen. He’s a crazy workaholic. I ask him what’s funny. “I was thinking about the journalists who came last year for the Bhumkal celebrations. They came for a day or two. One posed with my AK, had himself photographed and then went back and called us Killing Machines or something.”

The dancing hasn’t stopped and it’s daybreak. The lines are still going, hundreds of young people still dancing. “They won’t stop,” Comrade Raju says, “not until we start packing up.”

On the grounds I run into Comrade Doctor. He’s been running a little medical camp on the edge of the dance floor. I want to kiss his fat cheeks. Why can’t he be at least 30 people instead of just one? Why can’t he be one thousand people? I ask him what it’s looking like, the health of Dandakaranya. His reply makes my blood run cold. Most of the people he has seen, he says, including those in the PLGA, have a haemoglobin count that’s between five and six (when the standard for Indian women is 11.) There’s TB caused by more than two years of chronic anaemia. Young children are suffering from Protein Energy Malnutrition Grade II, in medical terminology called Kwashiorkor. (I looked it up later. It’s a word derived from the Ga language of Coastal Ghana and means “the sickness a baby gets when the new baby comes”. Basically the old baby stops getting mother’s milk, and there’s not enough food to provide it nutrition.) “It’s an epidemic here, like in Biafra,” Comrade Doctor says, “I have worked in villages before, but I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Apart from this, there’s malaria, osteoporosis, tapeworm, severe ear and tooth infections and primary amenorrhea—which is when malnutrition during puberty causes a woman’s menstrual cycle to disappear, or never appear in the first place.

“There are no clinics in this forest apart from one or two in Gadchiroli. No doctors. No medicines.”

He’s off now, with his little team, on an eight-day trek to Abujhmad. He’s in ‘dress’ too, Comrade Doctor. So, if they find him, they’ll kill him.


Comrade Raju says that it isn’t safe for us to continue to camp here. We have to move. Leaving Bhumkal involves a lot of goodbyes spread over time.


Lal lal salaam, lal lal salaam,
 Jaane wale saathiyon ko lal lal salaam

 (Red Salute to departing comrades)

 Phir milenge, phir milenge
 Dandakaranya jungle mein phir milenge

 (We’ll meet again, some day, in the Dandakaranya forest).

It’s never taken lightly, the ceremony of arrival and departure, because everybody knows that when they say “we’ll meet again” they actually mean “we may never meet again”.

Comrade Narmada, Comrade Maase and Comrade Rupi are going separate ways. Will I ever see them again?

 So, once again, we walk. It’s becoming hotter every day. Kamla picks the first fruit of the tendu for me. It tastes like chikoo. I’ve become a tamarind fiend. This time we camp near a stream. Women and men take turns to bathe in batches. In the evening, Comrade Raju receives a whole packet of ‘biscuits’. News:
•60 people arrested in Manpur Division at the end of Jan 2010 have not yet been produced in Court.
•Huge contingents of police have arrived in South Bastar. Indiscriminate attacks are on.
•On Nov 8, 2009, in Kachlaram Village, Bijapur Jila, Dirko Madka (60) and Kovasi Suklu (68) were killed
•On Nov 24, Madavi Baman (15) was killed in Pangodi village
•On Dec 3, Madavi Budram from Korenjad also killed
•On Dec 11, Gumiapal village, Darba Division, 7 people killed (names yet to come)
•On Dec 15, Kotrapal village, Veko Sombar and Madavi Matti (both with KAMS) killed
•On Dec 30, Vechapal village Poonem Pandu and Poonem Motu (father and son) killed
•On Jan 2010 (date unknown), head of the Janatana Sarkar in Kaika village, Gangalaur, killed
•On Jan 9, 4 people killed in Surpangooden village, Jagargonda Area
•On Jan 10, 3 people killed in Pullem Pulladi village (no names yet)
•On Jan 25, 7 people killed in Takilod village, Indravati Area
•On Feb 10 (Bhumkal Day), Kumli raped and killed in Dumnaar Village, Abujhmad. She was from a village called Paiver
•2,000 troops of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) are camped in the Rajnandgaon forests
•5,000 additional BSF troops have arrived in Kanker

And then:
•PLGA quota filled.

Some dated newspapers have arrived too. There’s a lot of press about Naxalites. One screaming headline sums up the political climate perfectly: ‘Khadedo, Maaro, Samarpan Karao (Eliminate, kill, make them surrender).’ Below that: ‘Vaarta ke liye loktantra ka dwar khula hai’ (Democracy’s door is always open for talks).’ A second says the Maoists are growing cannabis to make money. The third has an editorial saying that the area we’ve camped in and are walking through is entirely under police control.

 The young Communists take the clips away to practice their reading. They walk around the camp reading the anti-Maoist articles loudly in radio-announcer voices.

New day. New place. We’re camped on the outskirts of Usir village, under huge mahua trees. The mahua has just begun to flower and is dropping its pale green blossoms like jewels on the forest floor. The air is suffused with its slightly heady smell. We’re waiting for the children from the Bhatpal school which was closed down after the Ongnaar encounter. It’s been turned into a police camp. The children have been sent home. This is also true of the schools in Nelwad, Moonjmetta, Edka, Vedomakot and Dhanora.

The Bhatpal school children don’t show up.


Bob-Cut Brigade: In Bastar, women with a bob-cut haircut can get you killed

Comrade Niti (Most Wanted) and Comrade Vinod lead us on a long walk to see the series of water-harvesting structures and irrigation ponds that have been built by the local Janatana Sarkar. Comrade Niti talks about the range of agricultural problems they have to deal with. Only 2 per cent of the land is irrigated. In Abujhmad, ploughing was unheard of until 10 years ago. In Gadchiroli on the other hand, hybrid seeds and chemical pesticides are edging their way in. “We need urgent help in the agriculture department,” Comrade Vinod says. “We need people who know about seeds, organic pesticides, permaculture. With a little help we could do a lot.”

Comrade Ramu is the farmer in charge of the Janatana Sarkar area. He proudly shows us around the fields, where they grow rice, brinjal, gongura, onions, kohlrabi. Then, with equal pride, he shows us a huge but bone-dry irrigation pond. What’s this? “This one doesn’t even have water during the rainy season. It’s dug in the wrong place,” he says, a smile wrapped around his face. “It’s not ours, it was dug by the Looti Sarkar (the government that loots).” There are two parallel systems of government here, Janatana Sarkar and Looti Sarkar.

 I think of what Comrade Venu said to me: they want to crush us, not only because of the minerals, but because we are offering the world an alternative model.

 It’s not an Alternative yet, this idea of Gram Swaraj with a Gun. There’s too much hunger, too much sickness here. But it has certainly created the possibilities for an alternative. Not for the whole world, not for Alaska, or New Delhi, nor even perhaps for the whole of Chhattisgarh, but for itself. For Dandakaranya. It’s the world’s best-kept secret. It has laid the foundations for an alternative to its own annihilation. It has defied history. Against the greatest odds it has forged a blueprint for its own survival. It needs help and imagination, it needs doctors, teachers, farmers.

 It does not need war.

 But if war is all it gets, it will fight back.

Over the next few days, I meet women who work with KAMS, various office-bearers of the Janatana Sarkars, members of the Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan (DAKMS), the families of people who had been killed, and just ordinary people trying to cope with life in these terrifying times.




  
 
  

 Gram Swaraj with a Gun...it’s not an alternative yet. But it’s created the possibility for an alternative. Not for Alaska or New Delhi, but for itself.  

  
 
  
 

I met three sisters—Sukhiari, Sukdai and Sukkali—not young, perhaps in their 40s, from Narayanpur district. They have been in KAMS for 12 years. The villagers depend on them to deal with the police. “The police come in groups of two to three hundred. They steal everything: jewellery, chickens, pigs, pots and pans, bows and arrows,” Sukkali says, “they won’t even leave a knife.” Her house in Innar has been burned twice, once by the Naga battalion and once by the CRPF Sukhiari has been arrested and jailed in Jagdalpur for seven months. “Once they took away the whole village, saying the men were all Naxals.” Sukhiari followed with all the women and children. They surrounded the police station and refused to leave until the men were freed. “Whenever they take someone away,” Sukdai says, “you have to go immediately and snatch them back. Before they write any report. Once they write in their book, it becomes very difficult.”

Sukhiari, who as a child was abducted and forcibly married to an older man (she ran away and went to live with her sister), now organises mass rallies, speaks at meetings. The men depend on her for protection. I asked her what the party means to her. “Naxalvaad ka matlab hamara parivaar (Naxalvaad means our family). When we hear of an attack, it is like our family has been hurt,” Sukhiari says.

 I asked her if she knew who Mao was. She smiled shyly, “He was a leader. We’re working for his vision.”

I met Comrade Somari Gawde. Twenty years old, and she has already served a two-year jail sentence in Jagdalpur. She was in Innar village on January 8, 2007, the day that 740 policemen laid a cordon around it because they had information that Comrade Niti was there. (She was, but she had left by the time they arrived.) But the village militia, of which Somari was a member, was still there. The police opened fire at dawn. They killed two boys, Suklal Gawde and Kachroo Gota. Then they caught three others, two boys, Dusri Salam and Ranai, and Somari. Dusri and Ranai were tied up and shot. Somari was beaten within an inch of her life. The police got a tractor with a trailer and loaded the dead bodies into it. Somari was made to sit with the dead bodies and taken to Narayanpur.




  
 
  

 Booby-traps has become a Gondi word. Everyone smiles when they hear it. They know other words too: Cordon and Search, Advance, Retreat.  

  
 
  
 

I met Chamri, mother of Comrade Dilip who was shot on July 6, 2009. She says that after they killed him, the police tied her son’s body to a pole, like an animal and carried it with them. (They need to produce bodies to get their cash rewards, before someone else muscles in on the kill.) Chamri ran behind them all the way to the police station. By the time they reached, the body did not have a scrap of clothing on it. On the way, Chamri says, they left the body by the roadside while they stopped at a dhaba to have tea and biscuits. (Which they did not pay for.) Picture this mother for a moment, following her son’s corpse through the forest, stopping at a distance to wait for his murderers to finish their tea. They did not let her have her son’s body back so she could give him a proper funeral. They only let her throw a fistful of earth in the pit in which they buried the others they had killed that day. Chamri says she wants revenge. Badla ku badla. Blood for blood.

 I met the elected members of the Marskola Janatana Sarkar that administers six villages. They described a police raid: they come at night, 300, 400, sometimes 1,000 of them. They lay a cordon around a village and lie in wait. At dawn they catch the first people who go out to the fields and use them as human shields to enter the village, to show them where the booby-traps are. (‘Booby-traps’ has become a Gondi word. Everybody always smiles when they say it or hear it. The forest is full of booby-traps, real and fake. Even the PLGA needs to be guided past villages.) Once the police enter a village, they loot and steal and burn houses. They come with dogs. The dogs catch those who try and run. They chase chickens and pigs and the police kill them and take them away in sacks. SPOs come along with the police. They’re the ones who know where people hide their money and jewellery. They catch people and take them away. And extract money before they release them. They always carry some extra Naxal ‘dresses’ with them in case they find someone to kill. They get money for killing Naxals, so they manufacture some. Villagers are too frightened to stay at home.


Dressed To The Nines: Adivasi boys in colourful traditional gear for Bhumkal day celebrations

In this tranquil-looking forest, life seems completely militarised now. People know words like Cordon and Search, Firing, Advance, Retreat, Down, Action! To harvest their crops, they need the PLGA to do a sentry patrol. Going to the market is a military operation. The markets are full of mukhbirs (informers) who the police have lured from their villages with money. I’m told there’s a mukhbir mohalla (informers’ colony) in Narayanpur where at least 4,000 mukhbirs stay. The men can’t go to market anymore. The women go, but they’re watched closely. If they buy even a little extra, the police accuse them of buying it for Naxals. Chemists have been instructed not to let people buy medicines except in very small quantities. Low-price rations from the Public Distribution System (PDS), sugar, rice, kerosene, are warehoused in or near police stations, making it impossible for most people to buy.

 Article 2 of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines it as:


Any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [or] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.


All the walking seems to have finally got to me. I’m tired. Kamla gets me a pot of hot water. I bathe behind a tree in the dark. But I can’t eat dinner and crawl into my bag to sleep. Comrade Raju announces that we have to move. This happens frequently, of course, but tonight it’s hard. We have been camped in an open meadow. We’d heard shelling in the distance. There are 104 of us. Once again, single file through the night. Crickets. The smell of something like lavender. It must have been past 11 when we arrived at the place where we will spend the night. An outcrop of rocks. Formation. Roll call. Someone switches on the radio. BBC says there’s been an attack on a camp of Eastern Frontier Rifles in Lalgarh, West Bengal. Sixty Maoists on motorcycles. Fourteen policemen killed. Ten missing. Weapons snatched. There’s a murmur of pleasure in the ranks. Maoist leader Kishenji is being interviewed. When will you stop this violence and come for talks? When Operation Green Hunt is called off. Any time. Tell Chidambaram we will talk. Next question: it’s dark now, you have laid landmines, reinforcements have been called in, will you attack them too? Kishenji: Yes, of course, otherwise people will beat me. There’s laughter in the ranks. Sukhdev the clarifier says, “They always say landmines. We don’t use landmines. We use IEDs.”

Another luxury suite in the thousand-star hotel. I’m feeling ill. It starts to rain. There’s a little giggling. Kamla throws a jhilli over me. What more do I need? Everyone else just rolls themselves into their jhillis.

 By next morning the body count in Lalgarh has gone up to 21, 10 missing.

 Comrade Raju is considerate this morning. We don’t move till evening.

One night, people are crowded like moths around a point of light. It’s Comrade Sukhdev’s tiny computer, powered by a solar panel, and they’re watching Mother India, the barrels of their rifles silhouetted against the sky. Kamla doesn’t seem interested. I ask her if she likes watching movies. “Nahin didi. Sirf ambush video (No didi. Only ambush videos).” Later, I ask Comrade Sukhdev about these ambush videos. Without batting an eyelid, he plays one for me.

 It starts with shots of Dandakaranya, rivers, waterfalls, the close-up of a bare branch of a tree, a brainfever bird calling. Then suddenly a comrade is wiring up an IED, concealing it with dry leaves. A cavalcade of motorcycles is blown up. There are mutilated bodies and burning bikes. The weapons are being snatched. Three policemen, looking shell-shocked, have been tied up.

 Who’s filming it? Who’s directing operations? Who’s reassuring the captured cops that they will be released if they surrender? (They were. I confirm that later.)

 I know that gentle, reassuring voice. It’s Comrade Venu.

“It’s the Kudur ambush,” Comrade Sukhdev says.

 He also has a video archive of burned villages, testimonies from eyewitnesses and relatives of the dead. On the singed wall of a burnt house, it says, ‘Nagaaa! Born to Kill!’ There’s footage of a little boy whose fingers were chopped off to inaugurate the Bastar chapter of Operation Green Hunt. (There’s even a TV interview with me. My study. My books. Strange.)

 At night, on the radio, there’s news of another Naxal Attack. This one in Jamui, Bihar. It says 125 Maoists attacked a village and killed 10 people belonging to the Kora tribe in retaliation for giving police information that led to the death of six Maoists. Of course, we know that the media report may or may not be true. But, if it is, this one’s unforgivable. Comrade Raju and Sukhdev look distinctly uncomfortable.

 The news that has been coming from Jharkhand and Bihar is disturbing. The gruesome beheading of the policeman Francis Induvar is still fresh in everyone’s mind. It’s a reminder of how easily the discipline of armed struggle can dissolve into lumpen acts of criminalised violence, or into ugly wars of identity between castes and communities and religious groups. By institutionalising injustice in the way that it does, the Indian State has turned this country into a tinderbox of massive unrest. The government is quite wrong if it thinks that by carrying out ‘targeted assassinations’ to render the CPI (Maoist) ‘headless’, it will end the violence. On the contrary, the violence will spread and intensify, and the government will have nobody to talk to.

On my last few days, we meander through the lush, beautiful Indravati valley. As we walk along a hillside, we see another line of people walking in the same direction, but on the other side of the river. I’m told they are on their way to an anti-dam meeting in Kudur village. They’re overground and unarmed. A local rally for the valley. I jump ship and join them.




  
 
  

 The government has Koya Commandos, the CAF, CRPF, ITBP, CISF, Cobras, Scorpions. And a policy called wham: Winning Hearts and Minds.  

  
 
  
 

The Bodhghat dam will submerge the entire area that we have been walking in for days. All that forest, all that history, all those stories. More than 100 villages. Is that the plan then? To drown people like rats, so that the integrated steel plant in Lohandiguda and the bauxite mine and aluminium refinery in the Keshkal ghats can have the river?

 At the meeting, people who have come from miles away say the same thing we have all heard for years. We will drown, but we won’t move! They are thrilled that someone from Delhi is with them. I tell them Delhi is a cruel city that neither knows nor cares about them.

 Only weeks before I came to Dandakaranya, I visited Gujarat. The Sardar Sarovar Dam has more or less reached its full height now. And almost every single thing the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) predicted would happen has happened. People who were displaced have not been rehabilitated, but that goes without saying. The canals have not been built. There’s no money. So Narmada water is being diverted into the empty riverbed of the Sabarmati (which was dammed a long time ago.) Most of the water is being guzzled by cities and big industry. The downstream effects—saltwater ingress into an estuary with no river—are becoming impossible to mitigate.


The Long March: Maoists on the move in Bastar, single file as always

There was a time when believing that Big Dams were the ‘temples of modern India’ was misguided, but perhaps understandable. But today, after all that has happened, and when we know all that we do, it has to be said that Big Dams are a crime against humanity.

 The Bodhghat dam was shelved in 1984 after local people protested. Who will stop it now? Who will prevent the foundation stone from being laid? Who will stop the Indravati from being stolen? Someone must.

On the last night, we camped at the base of the steep hill we would climb in the morning, to emerge on the road from where a motorcycle would pick me up. The forest has changed even since I first entered it. The chiraunji, silk-cotton and mango trees have begun to flower.

 The villagers from Kudur send a huge pot of freshly-caught fish to the camp. And a list for me, of 71 kinds of fruit, vegetables, pulses and insects they get from the forest and grow in their fields, along with the market price. It’s just a list. But it’s also a map of their world.

 Jungle post arrives. Two biscuits for me. A poem and a pressed flower from Comrade Narmada. A lovely letter from Maase. (Who is she? Will I ever know?)

 Comrade Sukhdev asks if he can download the music from my Ipod onto his computer. We listen to a recording of Iqbal Bano singing Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s Hum Dekhenge (We will Witness the Day) at the famous concert in Lahore at the height of the repression during the Zia-ul-Haq years.


Jab ahl-e-safa-Mardud-e-haram,
 Masnad pe bithaiye jayenge

 (When the heretics and the reviled will be seated on high)

 Sab taaj uchhale jayenge
 Sab takht giraye jayenge

 (All crowns will be snatched away
 All thrones toppled)

 Hum dekhenge

Fifty thousand people in the audience in that Pakistan begin a defiant chant: Inqilab Zindabad! Inqilab Zindabad! All these years later, that chant reverberates around this forest. Strange, the alliances that get made.

 The home minister’s been issuing veiled threats to those who “erroneously offer intellectual and material support to Maoists”. Does sharing music qualify?




  
 
  

 Does the government think that by rendering CPI (Maoist) headless, it’ll end the violence? It’ll only spread and they’ll have no one to talk to.  

  
 
  
 

At dawn, I say goodbye to Comrade Madhav and Joori, to young Mangtu and all the others. Comrade Chandu has gone to organise the bikes, and will come with me to the main road. Comrade Raju isn’t coming (the climb would be hell on his knees). Comrade Niti (Most Wanted), Comrade Sukhdev, Kamla and five others will take me up the hill. As we start walking, Niti and Sukhdev casually but simultaneously unclick the safety catches of their AKs. It’s the first time I’ve seen them do that. We’re approaching the ‘Border’. “Do you know what to do if we come under fire?” Sukhdev asks casually, as though it was the most natural thing in the world.

“Yes,” I said, “immediately declare an indefinite hunger strike.”

He sat down on a rock and laughed. We climbed for about an hour. Just below the road, we sat in a rocky alcove, completely concealed, like an ambush party, listening for the sound of the bikes. When it comes, the farewell must be quick. Lal Salaam Comrades.

 When I looked back, they were still there. Waving. A little knot. People who live with their dreams, while the rest of the world lives with its nightmares. Every night I think of this journey. That night sky, those forest paths. I see Comrade Kamla’s heels in her scuffed chappals, lit by the light of my torch. I know she must be on the move.

Oracle Of The Forest

Arundhati Roy irritates me—her tone, her smugness, her careless use of history; specifically, her stringing of disparate events and phenomena as if they all amounted to the same old same old (eg, the lumping together of the Indian annexation of Hyderabad as part of the country’s “colonialis[t]” course, bizarre given the old order displaced was an absolute monarchy hijacked by religious revivalists in its twilight, an old order diametrically opposed to the sort of peasant insurgency one would expect Roy to be sympathetic to were the Indian state not on the “other” side), her sloppy view that the Indian polity is no more than an “upper caste Hindu state”—are annoying not only in themselves, but because they mar the force of her arguments, on issues so crucial one can ill afford to slip up (Walking with the Comrades, Mar 25). But. But. But. For the courage to talk about what other writers in English barely touch upon, and rarely without resort to the empty platitudes of those who use language not to think about problems but to avoid them, everything she writes on the plight of the Indian polity’s ultimate expendables—the tribals—can’t be missed. 

Umair Muhajir, New York


This is the only article of Arundhati’s that I’ve read and some of the facts she mentions ring true to me. For example, I have seen strategic hamleting in Mizoram around 1977 when I was working in the nehu. A highway was built from one end of the state to the other, villages were shifted near the highway, (and I was told) fenced off, and the villagers needed identity cards to leave the fenced area to their farms. Rahul Banerjee, who worked for about 25 years with tribals in Central India, has similar things to say in his work, Recovering the Lost Tongue: The Saga of Environmental Struggles in Central India. 

Anandaswarup Gadde, Melbourne


Speechless. That’s how Arundhati’s essay has left me. 

Dearton Thomas Hector, Kollam


Meaningless! It’s what came to my mind about my own work (I do what’s called ‘peace-building’) after reading Arundhati’s piece. 

Agyatmitra, Pune


The counterbalance in Arundhati’s essay lies in a paragraph in the 21st page. She echoes our misgivings about communist revolutions worldwide when she writes about the “party” being a genuine people’s party when it is the suitor, but doubts if it will remain so after the revolution. History tells us that it’s never been so. Russia, Hungary, East Germany, China, Cambodia, Nepal and, at home, the people’s government in West Bengal suffice as examples. Are Chandu, Kamla, Maase and scores of their comrades in the jungle even conscious of these? These innocents, indoctrinated by a philosophy as heady as their mahua, are caught up in the illusion of the perfect, classless world. The need to believe in something better than their miserable existence has placed them betwixt the devil and the deep sea. A generation of young will die in the forest to live the delusions of others. The country will move on. What the essay tells us about the mining companies and politicians sounds plausible. The poor will remain removed from the dream. The dream will be lived by the others. God deliver us from this indecency of living. Or send us an Avatar. 

Samrat Chatterjee, Raipur


Outlook confuses me. On the one hand, it reflects all that is associated with big business and ‘development’—its glossy, screaming ads testify to that. On the other, it has something as remarkable as this! 

Talha Chowdhry, Bangalore


Arundhati’s is the only voice of conscience in an India blinded by corporate greed, political corruption, imperial hubris and utter injustice wrought on its own common people. 

Alfred Abdul, New York


After the hectoring voices on TV and in other print media, Arundhati’s essay soothed my soul and mind. 

Mini Mathew, on e-mail


Arundhati gives voice to the voiceless, and questions the government. We Indians need to be self-critical. When we shape our country’s institutions, we must ensure they are genuinely inclusive. That said, I think Ms Roy provides no alternatives. We simply cannot have a civil war in India. The Maoists cannot continue with their guns and goonda raj. And it is equally improbable that the tribals continue with their age-old practices in the 21st century, living in the forest and competing with endangered fauna and flora—fragile natural resources. India’s population is exploding and the only way to provide decent health, education and living conditions for everyone is through common agreement and the rule of law. How can the tribals be protected in the middle of all this? How can we prevent outsiders (either Naxals/police/politicians) from taking advantage of their ignorance? That is what we have to think about. 

Kiran, Grenoble, France


Arundhati’s essay was brilliant—for its narrative style, marshalling of facts and the intrinsic honesty in putting forth her point of view. But more than all this, Vinod Mehta deserves special credit for giving her the platform—and space—for having her say. Which other editor of a mainstream newsmagazine today would allot 31 out of 50 editorial pages for a story like this? 

Derek Bose, on e-mail


Arundhati deserves praise for going where none of our armchair journalists go. 

Dinesh Kumar, Chandigarh


Did Arundhati actually go to Dantewada or has she written her piece sitting in the AC study of a five-star residential address in the capital? 

M.J. Mansharamani, Nagpur


At the end of 2008, I was in Gadchiroli for some research. The stories I heard were quite different from those in Arundhati Roy’s essay. I heard about the murder of a local leader trying to organise his community. More than one person told me that a politician, afraid of the man’s rising popularity, paid the Naxalites to kill him. I heard that the Ballarpur Paper Mills pays the Naxals to cut the bamboo from the forest and that the Naxals, in exchange allow the mill owner to develop the road leading to those forests just enough to let him carry the bamboo out. I heard that there are two job opportunities for people in these villages—the State or the Naxalites. That people from the same families are either in the police force or with the Naxal force. All poor. All desperate. All with little other choice. Unless they can feed their families with one rice crop a year. I heard that Naxalites won’t allow development, yet traders from Bengal have been allowed to set up businesses—for a price. Unlike Arundhati, I couldn’t sleep under the stars in the Dandakaranya forest, enjoying the beauty I was surrounded with. I didn’t have a friend or a comrade with a gun to protect me. Could this be true of others like me? Unlike Arundhati, I would not dare to give a ‘name’ or ‘face’ to the people I spoke to and took photos of, can’t post their images or tell their story on my blog or to a magazine that would want to hear their story. I’m no fan of the machinery deployed by various official, corporate and media forces that work overtime to push the poor and dispossessed who are increasingly ‘falling into the hole’ as Arundhati so eloquently puts it. However, I have heard with my own ears in Gadchiroli the voices of ordinary villagers—the poor, dispossessed and unarmed say in no uncertain terms that the Naxalites are the one-stop shop for the violent settling of scores. Any score. 

Nandini Bedi, Amsterdam


Let those who have eyes, see; let those who can, read and understand. I fell in love with Comrade Kamla after reading Arundhati’s piece. 

T.M. Dhanaraj, Chennai


For Arundhati, this is probably a thrilling escape from elitist seminar circuits in her designer clothes. The Maoists are supplied with weapons from across the border and they openly say they want to keep elected governments under pressure. They never demand roads, schools, hospitals, in short, better governance for backward tribal areas and brainwash tribals into believing that they do not need these. I’ve seen critically ill patients being carried on tractors to hospitals tens of kilometres away in these areas. It’s not just the mining lobbies that are the cause of the tribals’ miseries. The more grave threat is actually from the Maoists who deliberately deny them a dignified life and access to healthcare and education. 

M.K. Devarajan, Kottayam


Would these tribals have raised a war against the state—where they stand to lose everything for nothing in return—had they not been pushed to the edge of survival? And it is we who have pushed them to this brink with our supposedly developmental policies. We are the real perpetrators of the war, not them. And it is we who need to step back and give these desperate souls room to return to an ordinary, peaceful existence. 

Reader Man, Calcutta


The words of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire reiterate the incisive truth reflected in Arundhati’s essay. As he says in his seminal book, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, “Never in history has violence been initiated by the oppressed. How could they be the initiators, if they themselves are the result of violence? How could they be sponsors of something whose objective inauguration called for their existence as oppressed? There would be no oppressed had there been no prior situation of violence to establish their subjugation.” 

Raaj Mondol, on e-mail


If this was a modern country with real democratic values, Arundhati’s essay would have evoked serious debate and discussion, with debates in Parliament and media. In India, however, it will only generate ‘Has-VM-sold-Outlook-to-Ms Roy’ kind of response from its right-wing jingoistic readers or the hysteria of Arnab Goswamis. 

B.F. Firoz, Trivandrum


Arundhati’s piece reminded me of what the learned jurist V.R. Krishna Iyer said, “The Indian Constitution is deaf and dumb in these tribal regions. The leitmotif of people’s liberation is the spirit of autonomy, more human rights, less centralism and less illusions about peace through police actions.” 

S.M. Kompella, Kakinada


More often than not, mainstream media chooses to ignore the worst cases of state atrocities, not because it is not aware but because we the middle class can’t be bothered as long as there’s food on our table. 

Upendra, Winnipeg, Canada


It’s difficult to distinguish between the Naxals and the Navis of James Cameron’s Avatar. 

Mazhar Farooqui, Dubai


Journalism at its best. Thank you, Arundhati. 

Ashwat Ramani, Hyderabad


Instead of criticising Arundhati for speaking on behalf of people who no one else listens to, we should briefly put ourselves in the place of these men and women. What would you do if you were an adivasi doing the only thing you know how to do in the only place you know that exists and the government drives you away from there because it has conceived some fancy plan to exploit the area? Who do you turn to? It’s more difficult in India to touch a tiger belt than a tribal belt. There’s greater sympathy for animals in India than people. 

Sanjay Dhingra, Gurgaon


While Arundhati’s writing is persuasive, she doesn’t offer any viable alternatives. It’s true that tribal exploitation has been rampant in India and these regions are some of the most underdeveloped in the country. But by taking up arms against the state, they have ensured that doctors run away from clinics in these areas, government officials are scared to do their jobs and teachers are not prepared to go to schools. Is it Arundhati’s case that tribals do not need health and education and should be left to live happily off the forest? A majority of India’s population, however distressed we might feel by the efforts of our government, is part of the mainstream because we know it benefits us personally and as a society. Sadly, tribals know nothing better and their leaders have vested interests in ensuring developmental efforts do not reach these areas. Instead of romanticising the tribal dream, people like Arundhati should work with them to develop a way of life so that they can become a part of modern India, albeit by keeping close to their land and their way of life. 

Divya Bharati, London


A long story notable for little new except Arundhati Roy’s story-telling ability. Basically what she is saying is that the tribals of Dandakaranya do not need to learn to count beyond 20 and are best off if left alone to live as they have been for thousands of years. The use of violence to protect their way of life is also completely justified. Arundhati evidently suffers not only from directional but logical dyslexia too. If the world follows her foolishly romanticised path, change, the only constant, will become a bad idea, to be opposed at all costs. In short, she is effectively condemning the people whose cause she seeks to promote. She can’t see the tyranny of it because she does not have to lead that life; for her the fruits of the development she condemns are available—including getting her article printed here. Arundhati can pick up any group of people resisting change for any reason and write what she has written with only minor changes. One cannot shake the feeling that somewhere deep down, she is filled with vicious hatred. 

Vinod Sharma, New Delhi


I went through Arundhati’s entire essay and while I found enough stats on how much profits corporates make, there was nothing on where comrades get their money or arms from. To me, those who use tribals as human shields are as grotesque as the cops molesting women. Both amount to a rape of humanity. 

Kajal Sengupta, on e-mail


By going against the state, the tribals are only providing employment to the likes of Arundhati Roy and human rights activists. The state might consider Maoists the gravest internal security threat but our home minister needs to concentrate on how to deal with an even bigger one—of Arundhati Roy and her tribe. 

S.S. Deo, Gurgaon


The last time I read something like this was about Robin Hood and his Merry Band! Arundhati has, as is her wont, demonstrated brilliantly how a bit of erudition and verbosity can make a complete travesty of truth. 

A.M. Diwakar, Bangalore


Just a few weeks back, Arundhati was exhorting us to listen to grasshoppers and see how some Indians deny and even celebrate violence. Isn’t she doing exactly the same now: denying Maoist violence, nay, even celebrating it? 

Rahul, Delhi


What does a directional dyslexic, capable of getting lost in life’s objectives, do? As Arundhati herself says, “Come hell or high water, I’ll be holding on to Comrade Raju’s pallu....” 

A.S. Raghunath, Delhi


Roy loves herself and her writing, never mind if anyone else does or not. 

Gayatri Devi, Delhi


There’s only one editor and one magazine in India courageous enough to publish such a daring piece of writing. But why does he allow Arundhati to be bashed up in letters on your web edition? I wish the magazine would start monitoring that space and make it a forum for healthy debate like in the Guardian or New York Times. 

Edava Shine Kutty, on e-mail


It is becoming increasingly clear that, in the name of development, we are helping the rich become richer and the poor are being thrown to the dogs. In waging a war against this “internal security threat”, the government seems to be forgetting that these are our people too. 

Aarti Khosla, on e-mail


Sixty years of freedom and none of it for people who have lived thousands of years. What a crying shame! 

Kailash Chandra, on e-mail


Thank you Arundhati, for making us see how blind our government is. 

Jan ez Jalen, Ljubljana, Slovenia


Great effort, great journalism. 

Pankaj Yadav, Gurgaon


The time has come to redefine what freedom and independence really mean. If I can be displaced and hounded out of a land where my forefathers have lived for centuries, will I be called free? Yet, there is a ray of hope for Indian democracy that such an article can still be published in a mainstream magazine, that journalism survives amidst gutter press reporting. 

Narendra Murty, Calcutta


Every time Arundhati writes, readers often pick on the writer, missing the larger point: that the poor, the adivasis, the Dalits and other marginalised people are bearing the entire brunt of the nation’s economic march. Implicit in their criticism of her is the notion that our way of life is somehow superior to theirs. All subsequent arguments stem from this belief. To dismiss her writing by accusing Arundhati of being a romantic is being naive—and dishonest. 

Sajosam, New Delhi


While I can understand Roy’s empathy for tribals, I will never agree with the surgical tools of the Maoists. Given that, Arundhati has used the fundamental right of freedom of expression to the fullest—something no other country except the Indian democracy would allow—even daring to take potshots at the Father of the Nation. 

M. Ponnein Selvan, Chennai


Arundhati and her ilk should be banished to the luxurious thousand-star suites in Dandakaranya where they can collect tendu leaves along with the tribals and “live happily ever after”. 

Sudharshan, Madras


No doubt our democracy is imperfect and there have been human rights violations. But to compare it to the excesses of Stalin and Mao is revolting. 

G. Vijayaraghavan, on e-mail


Writing novels was too easy on Arundhati’s talent, I suppose, which is why she gave it up. Many in India can write a novel, and do. But few put their writing to the use that Arundhati does. One of modern India’s greatest writers is also a true patriot. 

Siddharth Chowdhury, on e-mail


The greatest service Arundhati has done to the tribals is to give them a name and face. What have Mangtu, Nirmala and Venu suffered in the last 50-60 years of independent India that they are ready to fight one of the biggest and most sophisticated armies of the world with only knives and front-loading rifles? 

K.D.M., on e-mail


Arundhati’s travelogue on the time she spent in the jungles of Dandakaranya in the company of Maoist cadres is a celebration of revolutionary romanticism and her own rebelliousness. You might disagree with what she says but you can’t but be touched by her poetic prose. 

Aparajita Krishna, Mumbai


“What this country needs is a revolution,” says Arundhati’s mother, the activist Mary Roy. And along with Comrade Kamla, Arundhati is “marching, not just for herself, but to keep hope alive for us all”. Women are leading the way everywhere you look, and we better take note. 

Ahmed Shamim, New York


Lal salaam to Arundhati Roy and the Outlook editor for standing against the tide of state-directed media. 

Ranabir Roy, Agartala


India’s gravest security threat, isn’t it Arundhati herself? 

Arnav Das Sharma, Nagpur

Exclusive 32-page essay? I could count only 31. Did Chidambaram censor the last page out? Or does ‘The Big Lie’ start with the number of pages? 

Pritam Sengupta, Bangalore


Arundhati must be smoking some good tendu if she thinks the Maoists are getting their guns and grenades from the Rs 120 cut from its proceeds they extract from the leaf-buyers. 

Jerin Chacko, Thiruvananthapuram


If solutions flowed from the barrels of guns, the Northeast and J&K would have been restored as heavens on earth a long time back. 

Alok Verma, on e-mail


Did the train, bus or motorbikes Arundhati would have used for her tryst with the Maoists appear at the wave of a magic wand? 

R.K. Asthana, Portsmouth


I am burning my copy of your magazine lest the police arrest me for being in possession of Naxalite/Maoist literature.

Much Mistaken

The yuppie-commie rhetoric has of late turned its guns on the Mahatma, or so it would seem from a reading of the Arundhati Roy essay Walking with the Comrades, (Mar 29). And the neo-Dalit is not far behind in this offensive. Harijan has thus become a dirty word coined by a condescending bania! Let us not forget the sub-human lot of the panchamas for centuries. The first and foremost Indian to view their state with utter compassion was Gandhi. And he identified himself uncompromisingly with them. But for the bania’s undaunted service to uplift them and the Kashmiri Pandit Nehru’s defiant enactment of universal adult franchise that at one stroke enfranchised all the scheduled castes, would there be Kanshi Rams and Mayawatis at the helm, unceremoniously kicking off the Gandhi ladder that pushed them up? For heaven’s sake, let’s not dismiss the sovereign role of compassion. What Arundhati Roy has for the Naxals and the forest tribals is unambiguous compassion. It is strange, though, that the lady has not a word about the Andaman aborigines, mercilessly decimated by the Indian colonisers and their government (the Union government is exercised over the declining Parsi population) or the unspeakable sufferings of the people of Manipur and farther east (Kashmir monopolising all her selective perception). Gandhian satyagraha is no pious humbug. The pious humbug was open to the lady when she was hauled up before the court for contempt, but she chose to cave in rather than be jailed. Please recall the classic non-violent rin mutiny at Bombay, to cite but one instance, that heralded Indian Independence. It is again easy to be dismissive of trusteeship, expediently choosing to understand Gandhi’s words literally. To go to the spirit of trusteeship, it means only ploughing back to society whatever surplus one may command over one’s honest needs. Roy herself has so ploughed back her funds, in excess, I fondly believe, of her own honest needs. 

Jayant Mrtyunjaya, Bangalore


After reading Arundhati Roy’s long-winded article, I wondered if she wanted Charu Mazumdar as our president and Kishenji as our PM! Kanu Sanyal has meanwhile committed suicide, but she could give Comrade Niti a responsible post. With her as home minister, the whole country can achieve the progress Dandakaranya has. 

Gurudas S., Bangalore


Some three decades ago, I travelled through the parts Arundhati Roy wrote about. Later, I made the same trip in 2001. Reading her article, I realise nothing’s changed there. Roy has done a commendable job in bringing out the other side of the Maoist story. 

G. Sondur, Pune


In Arundhati Roy’s essay, CPI (Maoist) Dandakaranya spokesperson Gudsa Usendi says that K. Balagopal, “usually meticulous about facts”, had said that the Naxalites had massacred adivasis at Kotrapal and that “later in his book (presumably referring to the Human Rights Forum report titled: ‘Death, Displacement and Deprivation, the War in Dantewara’) acknowledged his mistake...”. This is to clarify that Balagopal or HRF, the organisation he belonged to, has never issued a press statement to the effect that the Naxalites had resorted to the massacre at Kotrapal, nor has Balagopal “acknowledged his mistake”. When reports appeared in the press in June 2005 of the killing of a large number of adivasis at Kotrapal by the Maoists, the HRF wrote a letter to various civil and democratic rights organisations calling for a fact-finding in the area. Subsequently, a team of hrf and the Organisation for Protection of Democratic Rights visited the area on Jul 16-17, ’05. A joint press release was put out at a media conference in Hyderabad on Aug 3 in which it was stated that “the news of the massacre of June 19 in Kotrapal...is not true.” Both the letter and the press note can be accessed from the report on our website: humanrightsforum.org. Usendi, in this case, is shoddy about facts. 

V.S. Krishna, Secretary, HRF, Visakhapatnam


We believers in free-market economics will rubbish all the arguments of Arundhati Roy, but despite the vitriol we pour upon her, deep in our hearts, we’ll always know she’s so goddamned right—infuriatingly, exasperatingly so! 

Dr Oscar Rebelo, Goa


Arundhati Roy’s article is a wake-up call to India’s political establishment to stop its misguided tyranny against our own people in the name of development. 

Ranbir Singh, on e-mail


It never ceases to amaze me how naive the extreme left is. Arundhati Roy goes to meet the Maoists—and that’s courageous! She gives them a voice—and it’s her right to do so! But what rubs me the wrong way is her tone that goes thus—“look at the emaciated, courageous men and women who are taking on the jackbooted government criminals”. And while criticising the government for not developing the area, she calls the companies that are taking development there colonials. How does one develop a place in a capitalist system? In my opinion, Roy is a decent person but we’re lucky she does not run our country and hopefully will never do so. 

Frank Hawkins, San Francisco


I don’t have anything against Arundhati Roy. She is a gifted writer and I’ve always admired people who have the time and patience to take up cudgels on behalf of others, for whatever reason. Her heart is in the right place and she is obviously committed. The trouble is, she gets so carried away in her zeal that she simply fails to take the complete picture into account. Her arguments are so utterly lacking in balance, and her words so intemperate, that she only manages to alienate even those who are relatively sympathetic to the causes she espouses. The tribals do have some very real grievances but by throwing their lot with the Maoist insurgency, they’re simply asking for more trouble. 

Shaili Thakur, Chandigarh


The high priests of Left philosophy—Marx, Lenin and Mao—must be turning in their graves at the unique turnaround in the tactical equations between the ‘proletariat’ and the ‘bourgeois’. Instead of the ‘proletariat’ joining hands with the middle classes to throw away ‘bourgeois’ hegemony, now we have a situation where the ‘bourgeois’ intellectual elite represented by the likes of Arundhati Roy are joining hands with the ‘proletariat’ (read tribals in this case) to prevent the emergence of an Indian middle class in this globalised world. Upside down, inside out! 

Mihir Kumar Jha, Patna


Arundhati, mercifully, did not blame the invention of the wheel, and fire, for all the rot in the current civilisation. We wonder why she came back at all from her haven of violence. She could have had all the fun walking and dancing with her comrades, exchanging ‘lal salaams’. 

Bharat Trivedi, on e-mail


Instead of justifying the violence unleashed by the Maoists, she would have done well to question the central and state governments on the funds allocated year after year in their budgets for rural and tribal development. Where does the money go? 

T.R. Viswanathan, Mumbai


I am not an admirer of Arundhati Roy but her poetic piece was superb, to put it mildly. 

Jawahar P. Sekhar, Dubai


Arundhati Roy has obviously expended considerable energy in reporting from ground zero, but I dare say that the essay tends to romanticise the Maoist cause. She has conveniently glossed over all the needless murders and incidents of looting, arson and vandalisation these ‘comrades’ have been committing in the name of justice and alternate governance. It also seems from the essay that the whole movement is now itself victim to the adage, ‘the more things change, the more they remain the same’. What with different departments and an elaborate hierarchy, the janatana sarkars are beginning to resemble the same labyrinthine, faceless entities, without spontaneous popular support—much like the system the Naxalites are purportedly fighting against. 

Rahul Gaur, Gurgaon


Arundhati Roy’s article was to my expectation: Hindus are to blame for all of India’s failings; the victims are about everyone else. More than just pretty writing, the most striking part was the picture on the cover: the dainty, city-slicker activist in socks and sandals, well-protected from the elements, in sharp contrast to the barefoot Maoist girl sitting next to her. 

Lokesh Raina, Mumbai


Arundhati ought to realise at her age that there is no such thing as a perfect society. Man has always exploited man through the ages, and a Communist China or militarised Myanmar do nothing but exploit ideology. Common people like us have to just put up with whatever we have. By creating unrealisable hopes among adivasis, Maoists have only prolonged their misery, caught as they are between them and the state. We city-dwellers also feel the agony of the exploited. But aren’t we also exploited at every step? 

Santhanam, on e-mail


Arundhati Roy’s article has opened my eyes. I got to know for the first time about the kind of life Naxalites lead, the hurdles they face in their day-to-day life, the reasons for their taking to arms, even the food they eat. 

Sandeep Shankar, Delhi

Another Thousand Words

This is to congratulate both you and Ms Roy for the courageous and remarkably revelatory article on the tribal Maoists of Bastar. In the deeply distressing face of state violence and the caricature state and media present the tribal struggles as, it is literally Ms Roy’s pen and your magazine that give us hope, doing not just the history and humanity of tribal aspirations a service, but the conscience of us all. In this regard, I wanted to share with you a painting I just completed and that is currently being exhibited at the Reflection Art Gallery in Shahpur Jat in a group exhibition themed ‘Hope’. Titled The Truth Wins, it celebrates precisely what Ms Roy’s article and your magazine are in the process of achieving. The body in the painting is taken from a photograph of five innocent people piled in the back of a trailer, killed on April 15, 2009, by the police in an alleged anti-Naxalite operation. What struck me about the photo was the fact that surviving the terrible violence visited upon this body was a little ball-point pen clipped serenely to the dead man’s shirt pocket. That pen symbolises truth to me, whether through the media or courageous individuals standing up and speaking out.

What Now, Ms Roy?

Are you happy now, Arundhati? Some 76 innocent lives lost, thanks to people like you who glorify Maoist criminals. 

Ashwin, Chennai


Now that 75-odd Indians have been killed by their fellowmen in the jungles of Dandakaranya, perhaps the bleeding heart and tormented soul of Arundhati can be at peace. 

Balakrishnan Unny, Gurgaon


Congrats, Arundhati. Your men struck well, claiming 76 lives. Why don’t you now go and live in your thousand-star hotel forever? 

Chetan Rathor, Delhi


Will Arundhati now go to the homes of those brave men who were killed to write about them and their families? People like Arundhati should be made accountable for such killings as articles like hers create sympathy in the minds of most readers and portray the government, especially the forces, negatively. 

Nishant Chaudhary, Bokaro


The problem with Sonia staffers like Manmohan Singh and Chidambaram is that they breathe the polluted air of dynastic politics. So it is that neither the families of the killed CRPF jawans nor the rest of the countrymen have any hope from this toothless government. There can be no politics or logic when it comes to dealing with the terrorists. 

Suraish Kumar, Chandigarh


When the mecca of human rights, Amnesty International, can become a terror-supporting charity, why be surprised at Arundhati supporting violence against the government and her own countrymen? 

Narayan, Zurich


Even if we do not agree with what she says, we have to concede that Arundhati writes from her heart and that her heart is in the right place. 

Angarag, Guwahati


Arundhati’s might be embedded journalism alright. But none can deny that people like her arouse the conscience of the nation. The Maoists are indeed social fascists—mouthing socialism at one level but indulging in fascist methods of intolerance and cruelty on their opponents on the other. Their ideas may sound ideal but their understanding of the modern social reality and political-economic scenarios is outdated and archaic. Yet, one can’t, on this pretext, support state terrorism on tribal populations either. 

G. Niranjan Rao, Hyderabad


All men and women have human faces, however dehumanised they may be. If one were able to meet the attackers of 26/11 while they were among their kith and kin, revealing their “hearts and homes, motives and motivations”, they would have probably come across as equally gentle and deserving of sympathy as the comrades Arundhati walked with. Also, had she spent as much time with security forces as she did with the Maoists, she would have known better than to say —“Nagas and Mizos are sent to fight in Chhattisgarh, Sikhs to Kashmir and Tamilians to Assam”. Indians of all regions and religions form the sword arm of the government either in mixed- or class-based security forces. Thus they can’t be influenced by local pressures, or their families be open to harm, being far. When misinformed half-truths poison and bias minds, they move beyond the pale of “freedom of speech”. They are sacrilege for those who have the thankless task of defending the nation. 

Geeta Katoch, Udhampur


In her essay, Arundhati asks; “Is (the) armed struggle intrinsically undemocratic? Is the sandwich theory accurate? Are ‘Maoists’ and tribals two discrete categories?” My answer to all three questions is a resounding ‘yes’. Arundhati spreads the canard that the Indian police are being trained by the Mossad. She tries to distort the meaning of words to suit her discourse. She makes unsubstantiated allegations about judges and media. She calls B.K. Ponwar (who runs Kanker’s jungle warfare school) a dirty name. She uses sarcasm in place of facts. It doesn’t work. All I want to say is: if tribals wish to live a primitive life, so be it. No one should force them to change or convert. If they believe that industrialisation impinges upon their freedom, it should stop. Maoists have made a point; now, they should relent and eschew violence. Is that asking for too much? 

Madhu B. Thaker, Vallabh Vidyanagar


It is really unfortunate that we still believe that a military operation can solve the Naxal problem. China, Vietnam and various other situations have proved time and again that when a movement has the people’s support, even mighty powers have to surrender. 

S.P. Deolalkar, Hyderabad


The state can’t avoid answering the questions Arundhati raises. Mouthing platitudes about constitutional governance is all very fine, but what when it doesn’t reach people at all?

Cornered Folks

I’m fully convinced now how good a writer of fiction Arundhati is (Walking with the Comrades, Mar 29). She should go to Dantewada independently—without the protection of the Maoists. She should try to talk to the adivasis when the Maoists aren’t around. Maybe she should learn what Maoism is herself and then test the adivasis on their knowledge of that ideology. Let her do her work through independent and free research and then write. 

Chandru Kalsi, Mumbai


How I wish Arundhati understood Gandhi before calling the Maoists ‘Gandhians with Guns’. Doesn’t matter, though! After all, her tirades are meant for consumption by the West. If she finds nothing worth praising in the country she lives in, why doesn’t this mobile republic just migrate? 

Aditya Trivedi, Bangalore


What Arundhati conveys in her essay is not very different from what Mahatma Gandhi and other enlightened people who worked for the uplift of the worst off in India have said—that there is something drastically wrong with the neo-liberal economic path we have taken and that we need an alternative development model. With disarming honesty, she says she doesn’t know what alternative to offer the adivasis who have taken to the path of violence. But I think something is amiss if someone like Arundhati sees no hope in what she calls Gandhi’s “pious humbug”. Coming to think of it, Arundhati, Gandhi had the answer. As a Jain, I believe violence in all forms—manasa, vacha, karmana—is wrong. 

Kritee Shah, Ahmedabad


The reactions to Arundhati’s piece on the Maoists appear to me way off the mark. In a democratic set-up like ours, we have a large group of people who have been deprived of their rights and have therefore been forced to take up arms against their countrymen. The Maoist uprising in adivasi regions is an indication of the poverty, deprivation and frustration the inhabitants experience. Let the adivasis live peacefully in their lands and let them join the mainstream on their own. Let us not impose ourselves on them. 

Amar Heblekar, Goa


Apropos of Arundhati’s piece on the Maoists and Muhajir’s analysis of the piece and its context, I think what Muhajir says is true: we need more essays like Arundhati’s, but by others. Your cover story on the Maoists (Feb 22) carried more credibility than Arundhati’s. Ironically, by promoting the self-righteous Arundhati’s shrill demonising and romanticising of issues, Outlook will keep the middle class inured to the issues she passionately champions. Recoiling from the horror of reading Arundhati’s piece, they will continue to dwell in blissful ignorance. 

R.S. Krishna, Bangalore


Arundhati never supported the Maoists in any way in her writing. All she did is spend time with them and then pen down what she saw. It would be preposterous to expect the Barkha Dutts and Arnab Goswamis to open their eyes to reality.

The Fire Stokers

The Maoists could not have found a better advocate than Arundhati Roy to justify their violence (Walking with the Comrades, Mar 29) . Instead of bringing peace and prosperity, Maoist acts have put development in reverse gear. 

P.C. Sockey, Hazaribag, Jharkhand


Arundhati admits it is impossible to defend much of what the Maoists have done but in the very next breath adds that the Congress and bjp have more sordid achievements to their credit! Her ambivalence is also visible when she doubts the future behaviour of the “people’s army” but adds the face-saver that one should not immobilise oneself in fear of the future. Why forget that humanity advances through trial and error. One could preserve tribal culture, promote check dams instead of big dams, and work out a via media to take development to certain parts without “immobilising” adivasi society. 

V.A. Deshmukh, Ex-MLA, by fax


Thank you, Arundhati! I put off reading your piece on the Maoists because I knew it would make me angry. Sure enough, it did! Keep writing.

Is the murder of Azad in accord with the upa’s approach to India’s “greatest internal security threat”? Yes, if you recall Arundhati Roy’s words in Walking with the Comrades (Mar 29): “An article on the Internet says that Israel’s Mossad is training 30 high-ranking Indian police officers in the techniques of targeted assassinations to render the Maoist organisation ‘headless’.”

The Deal of the Century

As our financial system entered free fall last September and the people who ran Wall Street struggled to avert a complete economic collapse, an epic battle for power and, above all, cash was being waged between Barclays and JPMorgan Chase. The inside story of how Bob Diamond walked away with everything he wanted.

By Tom Junod

Steve Pyke


On September 23, 2008, Gerard LaRocca, a senior executive at Barclays Capital, the investment bank, got an emergency phone call from one of his employees in the bank's operations department. The employee was looking at Barclays' bank statement from its account with JPMorgan. There had been $7 billion in the account, and the employee had been authorized to move the cash from JPMorgan to the Bank of New York, which was Barclays' regular, or custodial, bank. 

But now the money was gone. 

Of course, there were a lot of ways you could lose money last September in the weeks following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Banks had stopped lending money, first to one another and then to everyone else. The stock market crashed, and trillions of dollars were evaporating from the economy. Lehman Brothers employees who had equity with the firm were left with nothing. But Barclays hadn't lost money in its dealings with Lehman Brothers. It was in the process of buying Lehman Brothers, the profitable portions of it anyway, in a deal that one of its traders likened to "hitting the lottery." It had done what it had set out to do when its executives had surveyed the once-in-a-lifetime wreckage of the American financial system in search of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and the $7 billion was part of its spoils. It was more than money to Barclays; it was money that Barclays had won after struggle — won from battle with the dominant player in banking, JPMorgan Chase — and so the $7 billion's very existence was proof that Barclays had what it took to compete for preeminence in America and therefore around the globe. The $7 billion also happened to be in cash at a time when Barclays, along with just about every other bank in the world, needed it desperately. 

The only problem with the $7 billion was that it was no longer there in the account managed by JPMorgan. It was lost. No, not lost — Barclays hadn't lost the $7 billion the way other banks were losing their billions, the result of bad bets, insane risks, overleveraging that expressed a feeling of institutional immunity when in fact it was an indication of systemic disease. 

No, it was simpler than that, and also infinitely more complicated, given the sheer size of the sum. 

The $7 billion had been taken. 

I was waiting in front of a restaurant in Hell's Kitchen, on the West Side of Manhattan, when a hired car, gleaming and black but fairly modest as these things go — a Lexus — pulled up to the curb. One of the back doors opened and out stepped Bob Diamond, the CEO of Barclays Capital, who, upon seeing me, thrust both of his arms up in the air, fists closed, in a sudden and awkward expression of triumph. 

I had met Diamond twice before, in his office, and he had been wary and constrained, to the point of seeming genially coiled. He is a trim and compact fifty-eight-year-old man who identifies himself as a Bostonian, as an Irish-Catholic, as a former teacher, and as a banker, and though he means to be approachable, he can come off as severe as, well, an Irish-Catholic teacher-turned-banker from Boston. There is, indeed, something almost priestly about him — the sense that he's using his ebullience to get you to mass. He has a long pink face and a long pink nose upon which he perches his rimless glasses. Under his gray eyes he shows fatigue with colorless dents instead of dark circles. He has a full head of coarse hair the color of a railroad spike, just now starting to turn gray at the temples. His body language is sprawling, aggressively relaxed, until it isn't — until, say, he's asked a question that puts him on the alert — and he contracts and snaps to. His modesty can appear pained and his informality studied. He has a habit of taking off his suit jacket and slinging it over his shoulder before sitting on the edge of one of the trading desks — a habit that his traders describe as his move, as in, "he has this thing he does with his jacket, when he wants to talk to us, it's his move..." See, everybody has a move, and that's what I was expecting when Bob Diamond got out of the black Lexus: a move, from a man in dogged control of himself. Instead, he pumped his fists to the sky, and he looked endearingly goofy and boyish — a conqueror somehow made innocent by the act of celebration. 

Of course, Bob Diamond has plenty to celebrate, starting with his conquest. He is the man from an English bank who bought an iconic American one, after Lehman Brothers defaulted last September 15 on $613 billion of obligations and became the biggest bankruptcy in American history. He is the man who stayed calm in a time of chaos, who stayed ambitious when dreams were dying, who thought big when others thought only of survival, who viewed America as the prize when most of the globe was recoiling from its contagion, who contended with forces vastly stronger than himself and emerged vastly strengthened, who made a $45 billion bet and got everything he wanted, saving thousands of American jobs in the process. He won when everyone else was losing, or, to put it more bluntly, he's a winner in a historical moment defined by losers, and his only problem is that he is a banker who lives in a time when bankers are mistrusted, especially the happy ones. 

Diamond is aware of this. The first time I met him, I asked him what his answer would be if someone sitting next to him on an airplane asked him what he did for a living. "I'm a banker," he said, before adding, "which used to be kind of cool." Was being a banker ever cool? Maybe not, but it was a profession that certainly conferred exactly what Diamond is at pains to embody — the status of the solid citizen, the kind of old-fashioned eminence that's rooted in community and a recognizable set of values. But that was before the expansion of the financial markets and the incessant movement of global capital redefined our notion of what a banker is, what a banker does, and what we might assume about his values. It is still possible to sit next to Bob Diamond on an airplane, because he is one of the few global financiers who will fly commercial. But Bob Diamond is one of the highest-paid bankers in the world, earning $42 million in 2007 before forgoing his bonuses in 2008. He became a British citizen, in addition to being a solid American one, and is such a regular at Davos that his decision to skip the financial summit this year was seen as an indicator of an era's end. He is no more still "a banker" than he's still "a Bostonian"; rather he is a member of the tiny global caste created in the last forty years or so by capitalism's elastic effect on the money supply and its acid one on national sovereignty. This is not to say that he's a bad guy, or that he's being disingenuous when he shows up to a photo shoot in the sackcloth of a plain navy-blue suit because he understands that his preferred pinstripes might make him a target. No, he's supposed to be a good guy, as good as a guy spearheading the consolidation of the world's banks is likely to get. Hell, in the events that begin with the death of Lehman Brothers and end with Barclays' purchase of its lucrative carcass, he was the underdog, though probably the richest and most resourceful underdog in the history of the world. And so this story — which is the story of Bob Diamond and Barclays and how capitalists behave when capitalism is under siege — provides a test case. 

Last year we despised and distrusted and derided the bankers who failed. This year we're in the process of doing the same with the ones who succeed. But public opinion, like banking itself, is a zero-sum game, and one of these days we're going to have to decide whom we can live with: the banker hauled before Congress to shamefacedly account for his staggering losses, or the banker who travels the world with his fists in the air. 


On September 12, 2008, the three masters of the United States economy — Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, and New York Fed President Timothy Geithner — called the half dozen masters of the universe to a weekend meeting at the downtown offices of the New York Fed. The meeting was, to say the least, not open to the public or to journalists; indeed, it was nothing short of cabalistic. The men who were called to the meeting were the CEOs and senior executives of Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup. These were men invested with the consciousness that they knew how the world worked, and also that they ran it. On this day, though, their confidence, in themselves and in one another, was shaken; the week before, there had been a run on the 160-year-old investment bank Lehman Brothers, and they had come to the terrifying understanding that they were responsible not just for their own losses, but for one another's. They had established an empire of shared power by extending an empire of shared risk, and now they were realizing that the risk they'd passed off to others was in the process of coming home. And so the meeting's local focus was really a global one: They were being asked what they were willing to do to save Lehman Brothers. But they were really being asked what they were willing to do to save capitalism and themselves. 

There were two CEOs at the meeting who had more at stake than anyone else. One was fifty-three-year-old Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, arguably the most powerful banker in the world. He was the private hand on the U. S. financial system, as Paulson and Cox were the public ones; and although his hand had for the most part a steadying effect, it was also very close to the till. What was at stake for Dimon in the Lehman crisis was, quite simply, cash: JPMorgan was Lehman's bank. It cleared Lehman's trades, which meant that the exchange of cash and securities arranged by Lehman's traders actually took place at JPMorgan. If Lehman failed, JPMorgan was, in Wall Street parlance, "exposed" — it would be stuck with the securities and the losses. During the previous week, Morgan had been advancing Lehman Brothers more than $100 billion a day in collateralized lending so that Lehman had the liquidity to cover its debts and stay in business, but the night before — September 11 — it had frozen $17 billion of cash and securities in Lehman's account and had, in the view of Lehman's executives, effectively finished it off. The execution came in the form of phone calls to a few key executives, and Dimon had earned their undying enmity by being on those calls but saying nothing. 

The other executive with a lot at stake was, of course, Bob Diamond, and what he had at stake was his own ambition: He was looking to buy Lehman Brothers and thereby become a Wall Street player, a man who men like Jamie Dimon couldn't afford to ignore. And, indeed, on the morning of Sunday, September 14, the assembled masters agreed to admit Diamond into their company — agreed, that is, to let Bob Diamond save the global financial system by buying Lehman Brothers. 

It didn't work. 

The deal did not go through, the trade was not closed, and the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings triggered a stock-market crash, a global bank run, and the destruction of trillions of dollars of capital. The meeting of minds and money that had been called to save capitalism didn't, and so people started writing capitalism's epitaph, or least epitaphs for capitalism in its most unfettered form. They even wrote about the meeting itself and how it proved that even the power of men like Dimon and Diamond has its limits. 

What was not written about, however — what has never been written about because nobody knew about it — was a meeting that was held just a week later, in the offices of Weil Gotshal, the law firm providing Lehman its bankruptcy counsel. It was not so grand a meeting as the meeting held at the New York Fed, but it had as much to say about capitalism and how it was being reconstituted. Indeed, it was either the last meeting of capitalism's expansion or the first meeting of its contraction, for it pitted JPMorgan against Barclays in a kind of cage-match fight as the rest of the world was collapsing. In the seven days between those meetings, between the meeting at which Barclays failed to buy Lehman and the meeting at which its takeover of Lehman was completed, it became apparent that the two banks' primary concerns were less the survival of capitalism than who walked away with a big pile of cash. 


In April 2008, Bob Diamond had received a phone call from one of the undersecretaries of the U. S. Treasury. His name was Bob Steel, and he was one of Diamond's friends. He'd worked for Henry Paulson at Goldman Sachs and now worked for him at Treasury, but in between he had served on Barclays' board. He had stayed in touch with Diamond through the market turmoil of the subprime-mortgage crisis as it unfolded early that year. Diamond says, "He made it very clear he had no official capacity to ask these questions, but he had two questions to ask me: Is there a price at which you'd take Lehman, and if so, what would you need for us to do?" 

Now, you have to understand: Barclays is an old British name and an old British bank. It's been in business for 320 years. But Barclays Capital is a new investment bank. It's been in business twelve years, and Diamond has been running it from the start. When Barclays first hired him to run a new investment-banking business, 80 percent of its revenues were from its retail and commercial-banking business in the UK, which is to say the business side of a bank you see at an ATM machine or a branch office. He created Barclays Capital out of a threadbare remnant of corporate acquisition and amalgamation called BZW, and then after BarCap promptly lost hundreds of millions of pounds in the Russian debt crisis of 1998, he had to go before the Barclays board and ask if they wanted to stay in the business of investment banking at all. They did and wound up strengthening his hand. Since then, he has made a practice of building BarCap "organically" during times of stability and "strategically" during times of crisis, and by April 2008 he had succeeded in making Barclays the fastest-growing investment bank in the world, if not one of the biggest. Diamond lived in London and became not just a British banker but also a British citizen, rooting for Chelsea with the same privileged fervor he displayed for the Red Sox, Patriots, and Celtics. But he was still an American, and he still dreamed of America. 

The subprime crisis that had begun in the summer of '07 gave him his chance to crack the American market. When he started Barclays Capital, he did so with the intention of competing with "American bulge-bracket firms," by which he meant the six or seven traditional American investment banks that had dominated global markets for the last thirty years — Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and, yes, Lehman Brothers. By his own standard, he had failed — "for all our success we were still a second-tier firm in the U. S." — but he was convinced that he had failed because, while standing for free markets, the big U. S. investment banks were in fact "an oligopoly" that discouraged competition. He felt that crisis would deliver him opportunity, and when the subprime crisis fell at his own front door, he did two things: first, report his billions of losses to the board, and second, ask the board for money to begin building his business in America. 

"It is only in times like these that organizations can improve their relative positions," he says. Still, he figured that he would start by luring the most talented traders from banks most shaken by the crisis. He never thought he'd be able to buy a bank outright — until JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns for some small percentage of its book value the week before Easter 2008, and then a few weeks later, Bob Steel called and asked him to name his price for Lehman Brothers. Barclays buying Lehman Brothers? It was as if Schweppes were being asked how much it was willing to pay for Pepsi-Cola. 

And yet Diamond was not so sure he wanted the deal at all. There was overlap between the two banks in Europe, and there was "absolutely no track record of success" when one investment bank bought another — especially when a foreign investment bank bought an American one. Besides, he had done so much right at Barclays, when Lehman had done so much wrong. How could an investment banker famous for instituting a "no-asshole" rule at Barclays buy an investment bank whose all-asshole rule was just as strictly enforced?

"Our first impulse was no," he says. But when he started looking at the business Lehman Brothers had in the United States, he went back to the board and reminded them what Bob Steel had asked. "I said, 'Let's remember the question. The question was, What price? So let's say the price is a dollar. Are you going to tell me that this wouldn't be transformational?' "

At the time, his question was hypothetical. He didn't really expect that Lehman Brothers would be available for a dollar. He also didn't know — "I know now," he says — that Lehman's CEO, Dick Fuld, was already having conversations with Henry Paulson, and Paulson was telling him, in Diamond's paraphrase: Get a deal done — we're not going to bail you out. 


On Thursday, September 11, 2008, a week that began with Henry Paulson's announcement that he was putting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into federal receivership, Paulson called Diamond to ask, officially, if he was interested in buying Lehman Brothers, which was enduring what one of its former executives called a "good old-fashioned bank run," couldn't get financing for its suspect assets, and had lost 70 percent of its value since the opening of trading that Monday. Diamond, who was in London for an investors' conference, took the call with his boss, John Varley, and with his two closest confidantes, BarCap COO Rich Ricci and BarCap president Jerry del Missier. Ricci and del Missier had both been with Diamond from BarCap's inauspicious beginnings. They asked Paulson if there was an American company also bidding on Lehman, because they were concerned about being used as a foreign stalking horse. Paulson said he couldn't promise exclusivity but told them to "come here and do your work." Diamond, Ricci, and del Missier took the last flights out of Heathrow for New York. They flew commercial. 

On Friday, September 12, Diamond went to the Barclays building on Park Avenue, where he was picked up by Dick Fuld's chauffeur in Fuld's car. He was taken to the underground parking garage and then took the freight elevator to Lehman's executive floor — the thirty-first, known as "Club 31" for its extravagances — and met the beleaguered Fuld in his office. He found out that there was indeed another bank in the bidding for Lehman Brothers, Bank of America. With Ricci and del Missier, he then went to the offices of Lehman's bankruptcy attorneys, and even as Timothy Geithner was calling the richest financiers on the planet to the New York Fed's headquarters and challenging them to come up with a solution to Lehman's problems over the weekend, they waited till almost eleven o'clock before they engaged with Lehman executives. As they waited, they had a chance to look at Lehman's books and were amazed by what del Missier calls the "size and concentration of its positions" in commercial real estate and private-equity lending. Simply put, Lehman had taken an ownership piece in virtually every deal it had ever done, until it had a portfolio of $50 billion that was the most radioactive portfolio on Wall Street. And, as Ricci says, "We decide we don't want it." What they wanted was "to take Lehman at a price, without those assets." It was the principle that would hold them in good stead in the week to come: Get the good stuff. Don't worry too much about who gets the bad. 

On Saturday, September 13, Diamond and the Barclays team went to the meeting at the Fed. The mission was clear: Save Lehman Brothers, hence Wall Street, hence the world, all in "business casual." Since he was making a bid, Diamond was off in one room; since he was also making a bid, Ken Lewis of Bank of America was off in another. The rest — Jamie Dimon, Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Vikram Pandit of Citigroup, et al. — were all discussing whether they wanted to pay to liquidate Lehman's radioactive portfolio, its $50 billion pile of crap. They decided they did. They decided they would. Barclays and Bank of America both bid for Lehman. Bank of America wound up asking for guarantees that Henry Paulson couldn't fulfill, since Paulson made it very clear he didn't want to do anything that smacked of a Lehman Brothers bailout. Ken Lewis went on to bid for Merrill Lynch, and Bob Diamond stood alone with his bid for Lehman Brothers. At the end of the day, the bid was accepted. A deal had been made. Barclays was buying Lehman Brothers. The world was saved.

On Sunday morning, all that remained was for the deal to be sent to the British regulatory body, the Financial Services Authority, for its approval. But there was a problem: A purchase of such magnitude required a shareholder vote. For that requirement to be waived, the FSA had to provide a waiver. The FSA declined. The deal was dead. Instead of being saved, Lehman Brothers was told to file for bankruptcy by Christopher Cox, the chairman of the SEC. The meeting that was designed to save Lehman Brothers ended with Merrill Lynch saved — purchased by Bank of America — and Lehman Brothers in Chapter 11.

There is still some suspicion, given what was to come, that Diamond never really wanted to buy a solvent Lehman Brothers — that he wanted to buy the bankrupt entity, and orchestrated a piece of subterfuge with the FSA. There is, however, not a Barclays executive who does not voice regret over the death of the deal that was on the table at the New York Fed, and Rich Ricci says that he and Diamond were "absolutely gutted." They went from the Fed to the bar at Smith & Wollensky, a macho New York steakhouse, where, Ricci says, "there was drinking involved." There, Diamond got a call on his cell phone. It was Bart McDade, Lehman's president. He told Diamond that Lehman Brothers Holdings, the bank, was going to file for bankruptcy. But Lehman Brothers North America, the broker-dealer, was still in business, and it was for sale. He wanted to know whether Diamond was still interested.

"I came back to work," Ricci says. "I came back over here [to 745 Seventh Avenue, Lehman Brothers' headquarters] at about four o'clock in the morning. Very little sleep. I started working with Bart on how this would work. And of course all hell broke loose Monday morning. The world sort of collapsed. And it was very odd here, very odd."

The crisis they had tried to avert was upon them, and upon the whole financial system. The Dow dropped 504 points that day, the bank-to-bank lending rate doubled, and the run that eradicated Lehman Brothers began to spread even to banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The next day, one of the principal money-market funds wrote off its Lehman holdings as worthless, and the value of money-market shares dropped below a dollar for just the second time in history. At the end of the day, Henry Paulson announced the Treasury's $85 billion bailout of AIG. 

Even amidst the chaos on those two days, Diamond and Ricci and McDade, together with teams of lawyers, bankers, analysts, and "deal guys," camped out on the thirty-first and thirty-second floors of the Lehman building. They were served food from the dining room on thirty-two; they didn't sleep. They knew, in the words of Skip McGee, who headed investment banking for Lehman and now for Barclays, that the value of Lehman Brothers was "melting like ice on a summer day. If we didn't do the deal when we did, there was no deal to be done."

At around noon on that Tuesday, Diamond left the building. He showered and grabbed a change of clothes. He called London and spoke to his boss and his board. Around three o'clock in the afternoon, he showed up with Bart McDade on one of Lehman's trading floors — the fourth. He was not wearing his jacket. He told the traders, over the intercom, that they had been bought, that they would continue to get paid, and that he would try to save the bulk of their jobs. Then, as if to remind the gathered traders that Diamond was their conqueror as well as their savior, the intercom played "God Save the Queen." This was the first public announcement that Barclays had purchased Lehman Brothers, and it was repeated on all seven trading floors and then in the auditorium. He got standing ovations and tears. The world had ended — was still ending — but Lehman, the cause of it all, had not. Diamond had done exactly what he set out to do, buying Lehman Brothers "at a price." 

No, the price wasn't a dollar, but it was pretty close: He got Lehman's U. S. operations and its headquarters building for $1.75 billion, including the assumption of some liabilities and a $250 million fee. And Diamond was pretty damned proud of it — pretty damned proud of getting his price. I asked him once if, seen in retrospect, the Lehman Brothers acquisition was a "no-brainer," and this was his response: "If it was such a no-brainer, why did no one else bid for it? We're buying the U. S. broker-dealer of Lehman Brothers for $1.75 billion, which is roughly the price of this building, which we needed anyway. No one else bid. Where was Deutsche? Where was Credit Suisse? Where was Goldman Sachs? Where was Morgan Stanley? Where was HSBC? This is a U. S. bulge-bracket firm, operating at the very top level, and you're getting only the crown jewels."

And then, on Wednesday afternoon, Diamond heard from the Fed. There was yet another price to be paid.

Bob Diamond was in for the fight of his life. 


There was something people said about Bob Diamond pretty much universally. Current executives, former executives, traders, and friends. Bob Diamond? Good guy, great with people. Charismatic. Has built a culture of decency at Barclays from the top down. Doesn't like to hear bad news, though. Will sometimes stand up and leave a meeting if the news is bad. Or will stop somebody midsentence — "Why are you telling me this?" So if you talk to Bob, you better tell him good news. Because Bob Diamond is a good-news guy. 

It seemed like something to mention in an interview — the kind of softball question that gets someone to talk about himself. So I did. And I watched Bob Diamond's face change as if I'd ambushed him with secret documents. His hands, which had been poised in his pinstriped lap, closed into fists. He got up and went to his computer, then sat down again with his arms crossed. He had his glasses on, and he peered at me over the lenses. By force a smile flickered on his face, then went away. 

"Who wants to hear bad news?" he said. 

A lot of people think government action saved capitalism. It didn't. Capitalism saved capitalism.

A lot of people think the government didn't have any plans with regard to Lehman Brothers. It did. The plans just didn't work.

The government, in the form of the Federal Reserve, had two plans, in fact. It had Plan A and Plan B. Plan A was to find someone to buy Lehman Brothers. When that didn't happen — when that didn't happen because the Fed didn't want to fund the guarantees necessary to make it happen — they went to Plan B. Plan B was the Fed's plan to deal with a bankrupt Lehman Brothers. It was a plan to keep order in the markets once Lehman went out of business. It called for closing Lehman Brothers the holding company but keeping open its broker-dealer — the part of the operation that bought and sold securities. That way, the broker-dealer could close all its trades, and all the people doing business with Lehman Brothers could get paid. So on Monday night, September 15, the Federal Reserve began advancing the broker-dealer $45 billion a day to stay open. The idea was to keep people from freaking out.

People freaked out. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers was like an eclipse in the Middle Ages, a portent and a fulfillment of portent all at once. It was the darkness that had the power to burn and blind. The birds of the marketplace went quiet, and the dogs howled at the sun instead of the moon.

The Fed went from being in control of the situation to being as scared as anyone else. It was a bank, after all. Banks were scared.

And then, on Tuesday, Bob Diamond played "God Save the Queen" on the trading floors at Lehman Brothers. It was the one unalloyed triumph in a week of unnatural disasters, and the people at the Fed had nothing to do with it. They had not been consulted when the dealmakers were holed up on the thirty-first and thirty-second floors of Lehman Brothers. They found out about the deal only about an hour before everyone else did. They were, in the words of one Fed official, "surprised."

By Wednesday afternoon, they'd had some time to think about it, and the Fed's general counsel called the general counsel at Barclays. If you're going to do this, he said, you're going to have to step in for us on the funding. It was a request of sorts. But it was also a requirement. There were a series of meetings between Barclays and the Fed that day, and what was clear to one of the participants was the role that fear had started play. "It was understood that the Fed was desperate to get the Lehman trade off its books," he says. Another says simply: "They wanted to get paid." 

Barclays had no objection to doing what the Fed was asking and even saw opportunity in taking over the funding. The Fed wanted out? Barclays was in. That was the good news. The bad news? As Lehman Brothers' bank, JPMorgan was also lending Lehman Brothers money. And JPMorgan wanted out, too.

Barclays Capital and JPMorgan are often presented as heroes of the crisis. Barclays bought what was left of Lehman Brothers when nobody else wanted to and saved thousands of jobs. JPMorgan operated as a quasi-public trust, its sheer size exerting a stabilizing force. Their CEOs even had similar names — Jamie Dimon and Bob Diamond. A few days before, they'd agreed on the proposition to create a liquidating trust for Lehman's toxic assets, with Jamie Dimon urging his Wall Street colleagues to fund it.

But the meeting at the New York Fed wasn't capitalism. It was about capitalism, and it was attended by capitalists. But it was a nearly collectivist exercise, with government inducing capitalists to cooperate for their own good and the good of one another.

Now, what happened later in the week, between Barclays and JPMorgan — now that was capitalism.


It wasn't a deal, you see. It was a trade. The Fed was involved with Lehman Brothers in that it was lending Lehman Brothers billions of dollars in return for collateral — sort of like a pawnshop loan. It wanted Barclays to take over that transaction — to be the one lending Lehman Brothers the billions of dollars in return for the same collateral. That was the trade. 

What made the trade complicated was the fact that JPMorgan was also involved in a pawnshop loan with Lehman Brothers, advancing Lehman Brothers on average $69 billion a day. It had a lot of Lehman Brothers collateral and was looking for someone to take it. Specifically, it was looking for Barclays to take it. And it went into the trade with what a JPMorgan official calls a clear understanding that Barclays had agreed to step in for its funding and accept the assets it had on hand.

Barclays went into the trade with no idea how JPMorgan came to such an understanding. Rich Ricci and Gerard LaRocca figured that the collateral that Lehman Brothers had pledged to the Fed was of good quality. They suspected that the collateral that Lehman Brothers had pledged to JPMorgan was not as good.

They wanted the good stuff and only the good stuff. 

JPMorgan wanted to give them the bad stuff.

This was an elemental Wall Street confrontation, and so, although Barclays' purchase of Lehman Brothers was supposed to be good for a Wall Street in grievous peril, it ended up a knife fight in an operating room.

The trade was supposed to be simple.

Barclays was supposed to wire $45 billion to Lehman Brothers. In return, Lehman would send $49.7 billion in assets back to Barclays. The difference in the value of the cash and the assets is called the "haircut," and it rewards the sender of cash for the risk it is taking.

There were, however, some problems.

First, the Fed was so eager — so desperate — to get its money back that it gave Barclays only one day to complete the trade.

Second, the trade was so large and put such a strain on the Wall Street infrastructure that nobody knew if it could actually be completed in a day.

Third, it was not simultaneous, as most trades are. In most trades, cash and assets are exchanged simultaneously at the bank where the money is changing hands — the so-called clearing bank. This trade was different, because the world was different. This trade was a fucking bet. Barclays was going to be sending the cash out first over the wire and waiting for the assets to come back.

And fourth, the clearing bank was JPMorgan, which gave it tremendous power. I mean, think of it: Morgan was going to have the money and the securities. So if you were Barclays, you had to trust JPMorgan.

Which leads us to the fifth problem:

It didn't.

The trade started out simply enough. On the morning of September 18, 2008, Barclays wired its first $5 billion to Lehman Brothers through JPMorgan. And then it waited to receive the collateral back. It took a long time. It took six hours to get $5.06 billion in collateral. Ricci's plan was to keep sending the cash $5 billion at a time and then make sure he got the collateral he wanted in return. But late in the afternoon there was a phone call from Bill Winters, the co-CEO of JPMorgan's investment bank. It was to Bob Diamond. Winters had a request, or maybe a challenge. Listen, he said, at the rate we're going, we're never going to get this done. Cut this $5-billion-at-a-time crap and let's get it over with. Send us $40 billion all at one time.

Diamond looked at Rich Ricci. The deal of the century would require the risk of the century. Your call, Ricci said.

Ricci wanted to keep sending the cash out $5 billion at a time. Forty billion dollars was a lot of fucking money. But he knew that this was Wall Street, that this was some kind of you-show-me-yours-I'll-show-you-mine moment. Winters was asking Diamond if he was in — all-in.

Your call, Ricci said.


On Wall Street, there are two kinds of jobs: back office and front office. The people who work in the back office support the people who work in the front office. The people who work in the back office are the analysts, the risk managers, the computer programmers. The people in the front office are traders. What separates the two kinds of jobs — what makes the front office so much more prestigious and lucrative than the back office — is risk. Risk is not just the lifeblood of Wall Street; it's the juice. If you can take risks, you get a front-office job; if you can't, you get a back-office job. Both are fine, but only one allows you to be a hero.

Bob Diamond had started in the back office.

In 1979, he took his first Wall Street job in Morgan Stanley's IT department. He did very well at it and became assistant to the CFO. But he could see what was happening on the Street, could see that banks like Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers were, in his words, "starting to take real risks." He had started his career on Wall Street just as the expansion of the risks banks were willing to take was about to change Wall Street forever, and he wanted to be part of it. So he accepted the assistant CFO job only on the condition that he'd get a chance to work in the front office. A year later, he got a job on the financing desk, as a so-called repo trader, doing the very same kind of pawnshop loans that Barclays was trying to do with Lehman Brothers. Repo traders are not heroes; most traders don't regard them as real traders, because they don't take positions, and their trades simply finance the trades that real traders make. "We still kid Bob about starting out on the repo desk," Ricci says, and if there's anything Diamond is sensitive about, it's his ability to take risks. He tells the story of being a young trader looking with pride at his book of trades because he'd never made a trade that lost money, until he realized that never losing money on a trade made him a loser on Wall Street, not a winner, because it meant he wasn't taking enough risk. He was shortchanging his company, shortchanging himself... 

At about five minutes to seven, on September 18, 2008, Barclays Capital wired $40 billion to JPMorgan. In an instant, he had put his bank at risk. Bob Diamond was all-in.

Bob Diamond doesn't like to talk about it. He doesn't like talking about his role in the trade, figuring that there's no upside to a CEO commenting on a controversy. When he does talk about it, he's cagey. He doesn't even come out and say that there were talks with JPMorgan about assurances with regard to taking over JPMorgan's financing of Lehman; rather, he says that "if there were talks with JPMorgan, then I was in on them." When he's told the story of Bill Winters calling and challenging him to send the $40 billion all at once, he smiles shrewdly, while keeping his dead-level gaze, and says, "Well, if Rich Ricci told you that story, then it must be true." It's only when JPMorgan, through an official close to the trade, says that JPMorgan received assurances about the trade from senior Barclays executives, including Bob Diamond, that Diamond rouses himself into an unequivocal denial. Assurances to JPMorgan? There were no assurances, not from Diamond, nor from anyone else at Barclays.

What's clear from Diamond's cloaked admissions, however, is the fact that executives at the highest levels of both firms played a part in the trade of September 18 and 19. And when the official at JPMorgan speaks of the bank feeling deceived, it's clear he means that JPMorgan felt deceived by, among others, Bob Diamond himself.


There are two numbers you have to remember:

The first is $15.8 billion.

The second is $7 billion.

The $15.8 billion is the loan that Barclays extended to Lehman Brothers the night before, when the Fed forced the trade on Barclays. The payment of that loan led JPMorgan to believe it was going to have its way with Barclays — that Barclays was going to take over funding for Lehman Brothers, and also take the collateral JPMorgan was looking to get rid of. The bad stuff.

But a loan of this type has to be renewed every night. And late on Thursday, the back-office guys at JPMorgan notice that Barclays has not renewed the $15.8 billion loan.

A back-office guy at Barclays says that it's just an oversight, and the loan will be renewed. After all, Barclays has more to worry about than a $15.8 billion loan.

Barclays has to worry about the $40 billion. You see, it hasn't gotten the collateral back for it.

And although the Fed is working to keep open the wire — the electronic conduit for securities transfers — time is running out, and it is clear that Barclays is not going to get paid, not tonight anyway. 

For the day, Barclays has sent $45 billion cash to Lehman Brothers via JPMorgan.

It's supposed to get $49.7 billion back in collateral.

It's gotten $42.7 billion.

It's short. 

Barclays is fucked. 

Diamond, it seems, has lost his bet. 

And then, at one in the morning, there's a deal: JPMorgan agrees that it owes Barclays a lot of money. A custodial account is created at JPMorgan for just this purpose. It's Barclays' account. It's Barclays' cash: $7 billion.

Somebody wakes up Friday feeling they've gotten screwed. Take your pick: It could be JPMorgan, when it discovers that Barclays didn't pay the $15.8 billion loan, and Barclays explains that it was under no obligation to do so.

It could be Barclays, when it discovers that JPMorgan has frozen the account with the $7 billion.

So let's change our opening proposition:

Everybody wakes up Friday feeling they've gotten screwed.

And it's still early.

It's about 5:00 A.M., in fact, when Mike Keegan of Barclays tells Alex Kirk of Lehman Brothers that JPMorgan has started to freeze Lehman's assets. Keegan is, like a lot of the people Diamond has brought in to consummate the Lehman purchase, somebody who has been with Diamond a long time. He has, indeed, the honor of having been one of Diamond's first hires at Barclays Capital.

Alex Kirk is a Lehman managing director. Like a lot of the Lehman people who have been brought in to consummate the deal, he has the honor of being with the company only a few months and of being both a newcomer and a survivor. He has been asked by Lehman president Bart McDade to close the trade because Lehman's original closer, its mergers-and-acquisitions guy, quit the day before.

When Keegan tells him about the frozen assets, he tells Keegan, "Call Bob [Diamond] and Rich [Ricci]. Tell them we've got a problem. JPMorgan is not going to close. They're not going to sell you one thing you want."

He is a Lehman person, you see, and like all of the Lehman people, he has dealt with JPMorgan before. In the week leading up to Lehman's bankruptcy, the Lehman people saw how JPMorgan responded when threatened: like a raging, squatting behemoth, "seizing and freezing assets left and right," in the words of another former Lehman managing director.

"JPMorgan doesn't want to save the universe," he says. "JPMorgan wants to profit from the destruction of the universe."

To Lehman guys like Kirk, JPMorgan is nothing but a predator. And so he warns Keegan and Ricci:

You're going to have to rewrite the entire deal.

The deal, of course, is not a handshake agreement. And at the heart of the deal is the list of assets that Barclays has agreed to purchase from Lehman Brothers, consisting of thousands of securities. The list, like everything else in the deal, has to be approved by the bankruptcy-court judge after a hearing.

And the hearing is today, Friday afternoon.

At four o'clock. 

It's now seven in the morning. Kirk is telling Keegan and Ricci that they have to rewrite the asset-purchase agreement in nine hours. That means going back to Lehman's books and finding securities that might actually be worth what Barclays is going to pay.

But the bigger problem is the $7 billion. One of the reasons the trade went slowly the night before was that the collateral that started coming over the wire was not the collateral that Barclays believed it was paying for. 

It wasn't the good stuff, from the Fed.

It was, in the words of a Barclays executive, crap. As in, I know crap when I see crap.

Fortunately for Barclays, some of the Lehman people on hand recognized it. They should. They'd sold it. These were assets that bore the kind of name that historians will decry when they write of the last days of the Era of Expanding Risk:

RACERS.

Restructured Asset Certificates with Enhanced Returns.

They were issued with an Aaa rating from Moody's.

Now they were practically worthless, so worthless in fact that Lehman people had been warning Barclays people about them. Don't take the RACERS... 

So Barclays rejected the collateral that JPMorgan was sending over.

"I don't know if Barclays knew that it was starting a holy war when it refused the collateral," says the former Lehman managing director. "But that's what happened. I think that JPMorgan got pissed because they're usually so clever at doing this stuff. Now it was being done to them."

But JPMorgan has a clever move left because it has the $7 billion — $7 billion is still a lot of money, and JPMorgan holds it hostage. If Barclays wants its money, it has to take the RACERS and pay the $15.8 billion. 

The knife fight in the operating room has begun.


It's Sunday morning, one week after the most powerful bankers in the world tried and failed to save capitalism. That morning, Alex Kirk turns to Bart McDade and says, What are we going to tell people? How are we going to explain this?

What Kirk and McDade fear they are going to have to explain is unusual indeed:

Two days earlier, at a bankruptcy-court hearing that lasted eight hours and ended at close to one in the morning, Judge James Peck had approved the rewritten deal. He'd approved the deal because he deemed it significant to the markets, to "the national economy, and the global economy."

And now Kirk and McDade fear that they won't be able to close it. The deal of the century is on the brink of collapse.

The $7 billion is still frozen.

And JPMorgan won't return Barclays' calls.

Because JPMorgan is furious that Barclays didn't return its calls.

The world is ending in silence.

That night, however, there is an emergency meeting at the offices of Weil Gotshal, Lehman's bankruptcy lawyers. A Barclays contingent led by Rich Ricci is there on one side of the table. They don't even know if JPMorgan is going to show up. But it does, and the common assumption is that the Fed prevailed upon it to do so, at the highest levels. The JPMorgan contingent is led by its general counsel, Stephen Cutler. He looks at the assemblage on the other side and says: You didn't really think you could close without us, did you? 

Some of the people at the meeting remember it for its mayhem — for JPMorgan "trying to bully Rich Ricci," and Ricci showing that he "doesn't bully well," and both sides eventually calling each other thieves.

But one of the lawyers remembers it as a "bunch of bankers yelling about what bankers usually yell about — money." And at the end, there was a settlement — "well, we thought there was a settlement," the lawyer says. 

And so it was that sometime early on Monday morning, September 22, precisely one week after Lehman's bankruptcy filing ended the era of Wall Street expansionism, a trade was completed that began the era of global financial consolidation.

Lehman Brothers NA, the surviving broker-dealer of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings, sent a package of securities to Barclays Capital. Barclays Capital wired back cash, thereby obligating Lehman Brothers NA to pay it back by the terms of the repo contract.

As foreordained, Lehman Brothers NA defaulted. Barclays forgave the debt, taking possession of the company instead.

The trade was closed, and Bob Diamond had his prize, for his price.

One day later, Gerard LaRocca discovered that the $7 billion he thought was in the Barclays account at JPMorgan was no longer there. 

You get the sense that they are still taken aback about what they had to contend with — the furies they unleashed — in their dealings with JPMorgan. They say they would never want to go through something like that again. They say that it was Wall Street hardball at its best and worst. They say that they've gone up against many Wall Street tough guys, but this was something different. This was inappropriate. This was ruthless. This was one firm making a bad situation much worse. This was a Wall Street giant exacerbating the distress of the markets. Sure, there were things that JPMorgan was unhappy about. It was unhappy about the deals it had on the books with Lehman Brothers and so it became unhappy about its deal with Barclays. But there was nothing that Barclays did that could have possibly justified JPMorgan taking its money.

In fact, by taking the money without warning or authorization, JPMorgan did something that was unprecedented. 

But for all that — for all of JPMorgan's ruthlessness — Barclays won at every turn.

They won everything they wanted to win. They got the good stuff. They made sure someone else got the bad. They went by the simple if pitiless principle articulated by Rich Ricci:

"What happened was we then decided very consciously we were only going to take these liabilities, these assets. That's it. The rest of it is in the hands of the bank, of the court, and of the receiver... Now, certainly we're worried about the past and trying to help our clients. But we are under no obligation to settle those things because of the way bankruptcy works. We have the advantage of a clean slate going forward but the disadvantage of trying to deal with Lehman clients who want to talk about the past."

Compare that with how JPMorgan fared. JPMorgan went into the trade looking to unload its worthless Lehman assets, and looking to get Barclays to fund the operations of the Lehman broker-dealer.

Instead, an official speaking for JPMorgan admits, We kept the dregs, and didn't get paid. JPMorgan was not very happy with Barclays Capital.

And so, when the $7 billion went missing, perhaps it was inevitable that Bob Diamond's winning streak would continue. It was shocking to Barclays executives that the Fed wasn't able to just make JPMorgan give it back — wasn't able to convince JPMorgan to right such an obvious wrong. But when the Fed forensically reconstructed the trade and both sides were called upon to settle, Barclays got satisfaction: $1.3 billion in cash and $5.7 billion in securities.

Bob Diamond got everything he wanted, because he knew what he wanted. He named his price, and he got it.


"Was it fun?" I asked Bob Diamond.

It was one of those easy questions he didn't like. Hard questions he could answer with dignity, with his combination of priestly remove and priestly magnanimity. 

The easy questions made him look a little queasy. He blanched a little bit, and his mouth tightened, like the knot of a skinny tie.

"I don't think there's any way you could describe anything we did over that period as fun," he said. "I think, in looking back, there's definitely things that we accomplished that we felt very gratified about — felt, gosh, given the situation, we really executed well. But there was no aspect of it — from the intensity, from vested interests on so many sides, from disagreements with people you trust and know well, to being frankly just plain tired — there was no aspect about it that could be described as fun. But we knew that when we started this process. We got on a plane Thursday night to come to New York. We understood the seriousness. We expected this to be one of the most intense experiences. We felt that if it wasn't something we were prepared to do, we should move aside."

They didn't move aside, of course. At no time did they ever move aside, and now Diamond was an American again. He moved to New York and went to work in the big building at 745 Seventh Avenue, which used to be the headquarters of an American investment bank called Lehman Brothers. Its facade used to throb with the color of lucre — Lehman green, in honor of all those employees who attested that they "bled green" — but now its pulse was Barclays blue. Dick Fuld used to go to work in the carved isolation of the thirty-first floor, but now Bob Diamond's office was made of glass and it was located in the corner of one of his trading floors. He had intended the purchase of Lehman Brothers to be "transformational" for Barclays, and for evidence of his success he didn't have to look much farther than just outside the walls that were his windows and the windows that were his walls. It wasn't just that Barclays Capital was now an American bulge-bracket firm in its own right; it wasn't just that out of the integration of Barclays and Lehman Brothers he had built what Jerry del Missier called a "flow monster" that kept capital moving with incredible efficiency. It was that in taking over Lehman Brothers, he had also allowed Barclays to be taken over, in what one Barclays trader called the "goddamnedest reverse takeover you ever saw." The culture at Lehman Brothers was American and aggressive, replete with its "animals" and its "killers," not to mention its jerks and assholes, and while Diamond cherished the culture he had built at Barclays from the beginning, he was willing to put it in play.

And so I asked him if the purchase of Lehman Brothers had been as transformational for him as it was for Barclays. Of course, being a journalist rather than a capitalist, I was thinking in sentimental terms — thinking that he might answer by speaking of what he'd lost, in terms of innocence, rather than what he'd gained, in terms of power and prestige. But his answer was right in front of me, as well as all around me. His jacket was off, slung on a chair. He was wearing a blue-striped shirt, with a green tie dotted with tiny emblems in the shape of Nantucket, where his father had once been the high school principal, and where he was flying that evening in a NetJet to spend the summer weekend at his mansion. His whole being was transformed and his innocence was the innocence of acquisition. He was transformed exactly as Barclays had been, and when, two weeks later, Barclays Capital announced — largely on the strength of its Lehman acquisition — a half-year profit of nearly $2 billion, Diamond's staid English bank stood with JPMorgan as one of the biggest investment banks in the world... or, as Ricci would have it, as "one of the big boys, for better or for worse." 










On September 12, 2008, the three masters of the United States economy — Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, and New York Fed President Timothy Geithner — called the half dozen masters of the universe to a weekend meeting at the downtown offices of the New York Fed. The meeting was, to say the least, not open to the public or to journalists; indeed, it was nothing short of cabalistic. The men who were called to the meeting were the CEOs and senior executives of Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup. These were men invested with the consciousness that they knew how the world worked, and also that they ran it. On this day, though, their confidence, in themselves and in one another, was shaken; the week before, there had been a run on the 160-year-old investment bank Lehman Brothers, and they had come to the terrifying understanding that they were responsible not just for their own losses, but for one another's. They had established an empire of shared power by extending an empire of shared risk, and now they were realizing that the risk they'd passed off to others was in the process of coming home. And so the meeting's local focus was really a global one: They were being asked what they were willing to do to save Lehman Brothers. But they were really being asked what they were willing to do to save capitalism and themselves. 

There were two CEOs at the meeting who had more at stake than anyone else. One was fifty-three-year-old Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, arguably the most powerful banker in the world. He was the private hand on the U. S. financial system, as Paulson and Cox were the public ones; and although his hand had for the most part a steadying effect, it was also very close to the till. What was at stake for Dimon in the Lehman crisis was, quite simply, cash: JPMorgan was Lehman's bank. It cleared Lehman's trades, which meant that the exchange of cash and securities arranged by Lehman's traders actually took place at JPMorgan. If Lehman failed, JPMorgan was, in Wall Street parlance, "exposed" — it would be stuck with the securities and the losses. During the previous week, Morgan had been advancing Lehman Brothers more than $100 billion a day in collateralized lending so that Lehman had the liquidity to cover its debts and stay in business, but the night before — September 11 — it had frozen $17 billion of cash and securities in Lehman's account and had, in the view of Lehman's executives, effectively finished it off. The execution came in the form of phone calls to a few key executives, and Dimon had earned their undying enmity by being on those calls but saying nothing. 

The other executive with a lot at stake was, of course, Bob Diamond, and what he had at stake was his own ambition: He was looking to buy Lehman Brothers and thereby become a Wall Street player, a man who men like Jamie Dimon couldn't afford to ignore. And, indeed, on the morning of Sunday, September 14, the assembled masters agreed to admit Diamond into their company — agreed, that is, to let Bob Diamond save the global financial system by buying Lehman Brothers. 

It didn't work. 

The deal did not go through, the trade was not closed, and the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings triggered a stock-market crash, a global bank run, and the destruction of trillions of dollars of capital. The meeting of minds and money that had been called to save capitalism didn't, and so people started writing capitalism's epitaph, or least epitaphs for capitalism in its most unfettered form. They even wrote about the meeting itself and how it proved that even the power of men like Dimon and Diamond has its limits. 

What was not written about, however — what has never been written about because nobody knew about it — was a meeting that was held just a week later, in the offices of Weil Gotshal, the law firm providing Lehman its bankruptcy counsel. It was not so grand a meeting as the meeting held at the New York Fed, but it had as much to say about capitalism and how it was being reconstituted. Indeed, it was either the last meeting of capitalism's expansion or the first meeting of its contraction, for it pitted JPMorgan against Barclays in a kind of cage-match fight as the rest of the world was collapsing. In the seven days between those meetings, between the meeting at which Barclays failed to buy Lehman and the meeting at which its takeover of Lehman was completed, it became apparent that the two banks' primary concerns were less the survival of capitalism than who walked away with a big pile of cash. 










In April 2008, Bob Diamond had received a phone call from one of the undersecretaries of the U. S. Treasury. His name was Bob Steel, and he was one of Diamond's friends. He'd worked for Henry Paulson at Goldman Sachs and now worked for him at Treasury, but in between he had served on Barclays' board. He had stayed in touch with Diamond through the market turmoil of the subprime-mortgage crisis as it unfolded early that year. Diamond says, "He made it very clear he had no official capacity to ask these questions, but he had two questions to ask me: Is there a price at which you'd take Lehman, and if so, what would you need for us to do?" 

Now, you have to understand: Barclays is an old British name and an old British bank. It's been in business for 320 years. But Barclays Capital is a new investment bank. It's been in business twelve years, and Diamond has been running it from the start. When Barclays first hired him to run a new investment-banking business, 80 percent of its revenues were from its retail and commercial-banking business in the UK, which is to say the business side of a bank you see at an ATM machine or a branch office. He created Barclays Capital out of a threadbare remnant of corporate acquisition and amalgamation called BZW, and then after BarCap promptly lost hundreds of millions of pounds in the Russian debt crisis of 1998, he had to go before the Barclays board and ask if they wanted to stay in the business of investment banking at all. They did and wound up strengthening his hand. Since then, he has made a practice of building BarCap "organically" during times of stability and "strategically" during times of crisis, and by April 2008 he had succeeded in making Barclays the fastest-growing investment bank in the world, if not one of the biggest. Diamond lived in London and became not just a British banker but also a British citizen, rooting for Chelsea with the same privileged fervor he displayed for the Red Sox, Patriots, and Celtics. But he was still an American, and he still dreamed of America. 

The subprime crisis that had begun in the summer of '07 gave him his chance to crack the American market. When he started Barclays Capital, he did so with the intention of competing with "American bulge-bracket firms," by which he meant the six or seven traditional American investment banks that had dominated global markets for the last thirty years — Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and, yes, Lehman Brothers. By his own standard, he had failed — "for all our success we were still a second-tier firm in the U. S." — but he was convinced that he had failed because, while standing for free markets, the big U. S. investment banks were in fact "an oligopoly" that discouraged competition. He felt that crisis would deliver him opportunity, and when the subprime crisis fell at his own front door, he did two things: first, report his billions of losses to the board, and second, ask the board for money to begin building his business in America. 

"It is only in times like these that organizations can improve their relative positions," he says. Still, he figured that he would start by luring the most talented traders from banks most shaken by the crisis. He never thought he'd be able to buy a bank outright — until JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns for some small percentage of its book value the week before Easter 2008, and then a few weeks later, Bob Steel called and asked him to name his price for Lehman Brothers. Barclays buying Lehman Brothers? It was as if Schweppes were being asked how much it was willing to pay for Pepsi-Cola. 

And yet Diamond was not so sure he wanted the deal at all. There was overlap between the two banks in Europe, and there was "absolutely no track record of success" when one investment bank bought another — especially when a foreign investment bank bought an American one. Besides, he had done so much right at Barclays, when Lehman had done so much wrong. How could an investment banker famous for instituting a "no-asshole" rule at Barclays buy an investment bank whose all-asshole rule was just as strictly enforced?

"Our first impulse was no," he says. But when he started looking at the business Lehman Brothers had in the United States, he went back to the board and reminded them what Bob Steel had asked. "I said, 'Let's remember the question. The question was, What price? So let's say the price is a dollar. Are you going to tell me that this wouldn't be transformational?' "

At the time, his question was hypothetical. He didn't really expect that Lehman Brothers would be available for a dollar. He also didn't know — "I know now," he says — that Lehman's CEO, Dick Fuld, was already having conversations with Henry Paulson, and Paulson was telling him, in Diamond's paraphrase: Get a deal done — we're not going to bail you out. 










On Thursday, September 11, 2008, a week that began with Henry Paulson's announcement that he was putting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into federal receivership, Paulson called Diamond to ask, officially, if he was interested in buying Lehman Brothers, which was enduring what one of its former executives called a "good old-fashioned bank run," couldn't get financing for its suspect assets, and had lost 70 percent of its value since the opening of trading that Monday. Diamond, who was in London for an investors' conference, took the call with his boss, John Varley, and with his two closest confidantes, BarCap COO Rich Ricci and BarCap president Jerry del Missier. Ricci and del Missier had both been with Diamond from BarCap's inauspicious beginnings. They asked Paulson if there was an American company also bidding on Lehman, because they were concerned about being used as a foreign stalking horse. Paulson said he couldn't promise exclusivity but told them to "come here and do your work." Diamond, Ricci, and del Missier took the last flights out of Heathrow for New York. They flew commercial. 

On Friday, September 12, Diamond went to the Barclays building on Park Avenue, where he was picked up by Dick Fuld's chauffeur in Fuld's car. He was taken to the underground parking garage and then took the freight elevator to Lehman's executive floor — the thirty-first, known as "Club 31" for its extravagances — and met the beleaguered Fuld in his office. He found out that there was indeed another bank in the bidding for Lehman Brothers, Bank of America. With Ricci and del Missier, he then went to the offices of Lehman's bankruptcy attorneys, and even as Timothy Geithner was calling the richest financiers on the planet to the New York Fed's headquarters and challenging them to come up with a solution to Lehman's problems over the weekend, they waited till almost eleven o'clock before they engaged with Lehman executives. As they waited, they had a chance to look at Lehman's books and were amazed by what del Missier calls the "size and concentration of its positions" in commercial real estate and private-equity lending. Simply put, Lehman had taken an ownership piece in virtually every deal it had ever done, until it had a portfolio of $50 billion that was the most radioactive portfolio on Wall Street. And, as Ricci says, "We decide we don't want it." What they wanted was "to take Lehman at a price, without those assets." It was the principle that would hold them in good stead in the week to come: Get the good stuff. Don't worry too much about who gets the bad. 

On Saturday, September 13, Diamond and the Barclays team went to the meeting at the Fed. The mission was clear: Save Lehman Brothers, hence Wall Street, hence the world, all in "business casual." Since he was making a bid, Diamond was off in one room; since he was also making a bid, Ken Lewis of Bank of America was off in another. The rest — Jamie Dimon, Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Vikram Pandit of Citigroup, et al. — were all discussing whether they wanted to pay to liquidate Lehman's radioactive portfolio, its $50 billion pile of crap. They decided they did. They decided they would. Barclays and Bank of America both bid for Lehman. Bank of America wound up asking for guarantees that Henry Paulson couldn't fulfill, since Paulson made it very clear he didn't want to do anything that smacked of a Lehman Brothers bailout. Ken Lewis went on to bid for Merrill Lynch, and Bob Diamond stood alone with his bid for Lehman Brothers. At the end of the day, the bid was accepted. A deal had been made. Barclays was buying Lehman Brothers. The world was saved.

On Sunday morning, all that remained was for the deal to be sent to the British regulatory body, the Financial Services Authority, for its approval. But there was a problem: A purchase of such magnitude required a shareholder vote. For that requirement to be waived, the FSA had to provide a waiver. The FSA declined. The deal was dead. Instead of being saved, Lehman Brothers was told to file for bankruptcy by Christopher Cox, the chairman of the SEC. The meeting that was designed to save Lehman Brothers ended with Merrill Lynch saved — purchased by Bank of America — and Lehman Brothers in Chapter 11.

There is still some suspicion, given what was to come, that Diamond never really wanted to buy a solvent Lehman Brothers — that he wanted to buy the bankrupt entity, and orchestrated a piece of subterfuge with the FSA. There is, however, not a Barclays executive who does not voice regret over the death of the deal that was on the table at the New York Fed, and Rich Ricci says that he and Diamond were "absolutely gutted." They went from the Fed to the bar at Smith & Wollensky, a macho New York steakhouse, where, Ricci says, "there was drinking involved." There, Diamond got a call on his cell phone. It was Bart McDade, Lehman's president. He told Diamond that Lehman Brothers Holdings, the bank, was going to file for bankruptcy. But Lehman Brothers North America, the broker-dealer, was still in business, and it was for sale. He wanted to know whether Diamond was still interested.

"I came back to work," Ricci says. "I came back over here [to 745 Seventh Avenue, Lehman Brothers' headquarters] at about four o'clock in the morning. Very little sleep. I started working with Bart on how this would work. And of course all hell broke loose Monday morning. The world sort of collapsed. And it was very odd here, very odd."

The crisis they had tried to avert was upon them, and upon the whole financial system. The Dow dropped 504 points that day, the bank-to-bank lending rate doubled, and the run that eradicated Lehman Brothers began to spread even to banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The next day, one of the principal money-market funds wrote off its Lehman holdings as worthless, and the value of money-market shares dropped below a dollar for just the second time in history. At the end of the day, Henry Paulson announced the Treasury's $85 billion bailout of AIG. 

Even amidst the chaos on those two days, Diamond and Ricci and McDade, together with teams of lawyers, bankers, analysts, and "deal guys," camped out on the thirty-first and thirty-second floors of the Lehman building. They were served food from the dining room on thirty-two; they didn't sleep. They knew, in the words of Skip McGee, who headed investment banking for Lehman and now for Barclays, that the value of Lehman Brothers was "melting like ice on a summer day. If we didn't do the deal when we did, there was no deal to be done."

At around noon on that Tuesday, Diamond left the building. He showered and grabbed a change of clothes. He called London and spoke to his boss and his board. Around three o'clock in the afternoon, he showed up with Bart McDade on one of Lehman's trading floors — the fourth. He was not wearing his jacket. He told the traders, over the intercom, that they had been bought, that they would continue to get paid, and that he would try to save the bulk of their jobs. Then, as if to remind the gathered traders that Diamond was their conqueror as well as their savior, the intercom played "God Save the Queen." This was the first public announcement that Barclays had purchased Lehman Brothers, and it was repeated on all seven trading floors and then in the auditorium. He got standing ovations and tears. The world had ended — was still ending — but Lehman, the cause of it all, had not. Diamond had done exactly what he set out to do, buying Lehman Brothers "at a price." 

No, the price wasn't a dollar, but it was pretty close: He got Lehman's U. S. operations and its headquarters building for $1.75 billion, including the assumption of some liabilities and a $250 million fee. And Diamond was pretty damned proud of it — pretty damned proud of getting his price. I asked him once if, seen in retrospect, the Lehman Brothers acquisition was a "no-brainer," and this was his response: "If it was such a no-brainer, why did no one else bid for it? We're buying the U. S. broker-dealer of Lehman Brothers for $1.75 billion, which is roughly the price of this building, which we needed anyway. No one else bid. Where was Deutsche? Where was Credit Suisse? Where was Goldman Sachs? Where was Morgan Stanley? Where was HSBC? This is a U. S. bulge-bracket firm, operating at the very top level, and you're getting only the crown jewels."

And then, on Wednesday afternoon, Diamond heard from the Fed. There was yet another price to be paid.

Bob Diamond was in for the fight of his life. 










There was something people said about Bob Diamond pretty much universally. Current executives, former executives, traders, and friends. Bob Diamond? Good guy, great with people. Charismatic. Has built a culture of decency at Barclays from the top down. Doesn't like to hear bad news, though. Will sometimes stand up and leave a meeting if the news is bad. Or will stop somebody midsentence — "Why are you telling me this?" So if you talk to Bob, you better tell him good news. Because Bob Diamond is a good-news guy. 

It seemed like something to mention in an interview — the kind of softball question that gets someone to talk about himself. So I did. And I watched Bob Diamond's face change as if I'd ambushed him with secret documents. His hands, which had been poised in his pinstriped lap, closed into fists. He got up and went to his computer, then sat down again with his arms crossed. He had his glasses on, and he peered at me over the lenses. By force a smile flickered on his face, then went away. 

"Who wants to hear bad news?" he said. 

A lot of people think government action saved capitalism. It didn't. Capitalism saved capitalism.

A lot of people think the government didn't have any plans with regard to Lehman Brothers. It did. The plans just didn't work.

The government, in the form of the Federal Reserve, had two plans, in fact. It had Plan A and Plan B. Plan A was to find someone to buy Lehman Brothers. When that didn't happen — when that didn't happen because the Fed didn't want to fund the guarantees necessary to make it happen — they went to Plan B. Plan B was the Fed's plan to deal with a bankrupt Lehman Brothers. It was a plan to keep order in the markets once Lehman went out of business. It called for closing Lehman Brothers the holding company but keeping open its broker-dealer — the part of the operation that bought and sold securities. That way, the broker-dealer could close all its trades, and all the people doing business with Lehman Brothers could get paid. So on Monday night, September 15, the Federal Reserve began advancing the broker-dealer $45 billion a day to stay open. The idea was to keep people from freaking out.

People freaked out. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers was like an eclipse in the Middle Ages, a portent and a fulfillment of portent all at once. It was the darkness that had the power to burn and blind. The birds of the marketplace went quiet, and the dogs howled at the sun instead of the moon.

The Fed went from being in control of the situation to being as scared as anyone else. It was a bank, after all. Banks were scared.

And then, on Tuesday, Bob Diamond played "God Save the Queen" on the trading floors at Lehman Brothers. It was the one unalloyed triumph in a week of unnatural disasters, and the people at the Fed had nothing to do with it. They had not been consulted when the dealmakers were holed up on the thirty-first and thirty-second floors of Lehman Brothers. They found out about the deal only about an hour before everyone else did. They were, in the words of one Fed official, "surprised."

By Wednesday afternoon, they'd had some time to think about it, and the Fed's general counsel called the general counsel at Barclays. If you're going to do this, he said, you're going to have to step in for us on the funding. It was a request of sorts. But it was also a requirement. There were a series of meetings between Barclays and the Fed that day, and what was clear to one of the participants was the role that fear had started play. "It was understood that the Fed was desperate to get the Lehman trade off its books," he says. Another says simply: "They wanted to get paid." 

Barclays had no objection to doing what the Fed was asking and even saw opportunity in taking over the funding. The Fed wanted out? Barclays was in. That was the good news. The bad news? As Lehman Brothers' bank, JPMorgan was also lending Lehman Brothers money. And JPMorgan wanted out, too.

Barclays Capital and JPMorgan are often presented as heroes of the crisis. Barclays bought what was left of Lehman Brothers when nobody else wanted to and saved thousands of jobs. JPMorgan operated as a quasi-public trust, its sheer size exerting a stabilizing force. Their CEOs even had similar names — Jamie Dimon and Bob Diamond. A few days before, they'd agreed on the proposition to create a liquidating trust for Lehman's toxic assets, with Jamie Dimon urging his Wall Street colleagues to fund it.

But the meeting at the New York Fed wasn't capitalism. It was about capitalism, and it was attended by capitalists. But it was a nearly collectivist exercise, with government inducing capitalists to cooperate for their own good and the good of one another.

Now, what happened later in the week, between Barclays and JPMorgan — now that was capitalism.










It wasn't a deal, you see. It was a trade. The Fed was involved with Lehman Brothers in that it was lending Lehman Brothers billions of dollars in return for collateral — sort of like a pawnshop loan. It wanted Barclays to take over that transaction — to be the one lending Lehman Brothers the billions of dollars in return for the same collateral. That was the trade. 

What made the trade complicated was the fact that JPMorgan was also involved in a pawnshop loan with Lehman Brothers, advancing Lehman Brothers on average $69 billion a day. It had a lot of Lehman Brothers collateral and was looking for someone to take it. Specifically, it was looking for Barclays to take it. And it went into the trade with what a JPMorgan official calls a clear understanding that Barclays had agreed to step in for its funding and accept the assets it had on hand.

Barclays went into the trade with no idea how JPMorgan came to such an understanding. Rich Ricci and Gerard LaRocca figured that the collateral that Lehman Brothers had pledged to the Fed was of good quality. They suspected that the collateral that Lehman Brothers had pledged to JPMorgan was not as good.

They wanted the good stuff and only the good stuff. 

JPMorgan wanted to give them the bad stuff.

This was an elemental Wall Street confrontation, and so, although Barclays' purchase of Lehman Brothers was supposed to be good for a Wall Street in grievous peril, it ended up a knife fight in an operating room.

The trade was supposed to be simple.

Barclays was supposed to wire $45 billion to Lehman Brothers. In return, Lehman would send $49.7 billion in assets back to Barclays. The difference in the value of the cash and the assets is called the "haircut," and it rewards the sender of cash for the risk it is taking.

There were, however, some problems.

First, the Fed was so eager — so desperate — to get its money back that it gave Barclays only one day to complete the trade.

Second, the trade was so large and put such a strain on the Wall Street infrastructure that nobody knew if it could actually be completed in a day.

Third, it was not simultaneous, as most trades are. In most trades, cash and assets are exchanged simultaneously at the bank where the money is changing hands — the so-called clearing bank. This trade was different, because the world was different. This trade was a fucking bet. Barclays was going to be sending the cash out first over the wire and waiting for the assets to come back.

And fourth, the clearing bank was JPMorgan, which gave it tremendous power. I mean, think of it: Morgan was going to have the money and the securities. So if you were Barclays, you had to trust JPMorgan.

Which leads us to the fifth problem:

It didn't.

The trade started out simply enough. On the morning of September 18, 2008, Barclays wired its first $5 billion to Lehman Brothers through JPMorgan. And then it waited to receive the collateral back. It took a long time. It took six hours to get $5.06 billion in collateral. Ricci's plan was to keep sending the cash $5 billion at a time and then make sure he got the collateral he wanted in return. But late in the afternoon there was a phone call from Bill Winters, the co-CEO of JPMorgan's investment bank. It was to Bob Diamond. Winters had a request, or maybe a challenge. Listen, he said, at the rate we're going, we're never going to get this done. Cut this $5-billion-at-a-time crap and let's get it over with. Send us $40 billion all at one time.

Diamond looked at Rich Ricci. The deal of the century would require the risk of the century. Your call, Ricci said.

Ricci wanted to keep sending the cash out $5 billion at a time. Forty billion dollars was a lot of fucking money. But he knew that this was Wall Street, that this was some kind of you-show-me-yours-I'll-show-you-mine moment. Winters was asking Diamond if he was in — all-in.

Your call, Ricci said.










On Wall Street, there are two kinds of jobs: back office and front office. The people who work in the back office support the people who work in the front office. The people who work in the back office are the analysts, the risk managers, the computer programmers. The people in the front office are traders. What separates the two kinds of jobs — what makes the front office so much more prestigious and lucrative than the back office — is risk. Risk is not just the lifeblood of Wall Street; it's the juice. If you can take risks, you get a front-office job; if you can't, you get a back-office job. Both are fine, but only one allows you to be a hero.

Bob Diamond had started in the back office.

In 1979, he took his first Wall Street job in Morgan Stanley's IT department. He did very well at it and became assistant to the CFO. But he could see what was happening on the Street, could see that banks like Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers were, in his words, "starting to take real risks." He had started his career on Wall Street just as the expansion of the risks banks were willing to take was about to change Wall Street forever, and he wanted to be part of it. So he accepted the assistant CFO job only on the condition that he'd get a chance to work in the front office. A year later, he got a job on the financing desk, as a so-called repo trader, doing the very same kind of pawnshop loans that Barclays was trying to do with Lehman Brothers. Repo traders are not heroes; most traders don't regard them as real traders, because they don't take positions, and their trades simply finance the trades that real traders make. "We still kid Bob about starting out on the repo desk," Ricci says, and if there's anything Diamond is sensitive about, it's his ability to take risks. He tells the story of being a young trader looking with pride at his book of trades because he'd never made a trade that lost money, until he realized that never losing money on a trade made him a loser on Wall Street, not a winner, because it meant he wasn't taking enough risk. He was shortchanging his company, shortchanging himself... 

At about five minutes to seven, on September 18, 2008, Barclays Capital wired $40 billion to JPMorgan. In an instant, he had put his bank at risk. Bob Diamond was all-in.

Bob Diamond doesn't like to talk about it. He doesn't like talking about his role in the trade, figuring that there's no upside to a CEO commenting on a controversy. When he does talk about it, he's cagey. He doesn't even come out and say that there were talks with JPMorgan about assurances with regard to taking over JPMorgan's financing of Lehman; rather, he says that "if there were talks with JPMorgan, then I was in on them." When he's told the story of Bill Winters calling and challenging him to send the $40 billion all at once, he smiles shrewdly, while keeping his dead-level gaze, and says, "Well, if Rich Ricci told you that story, then it must be true." It's only when JPMorgan, through an official close to the trade, says that JPMorgan received assurances about the trade from senior Barclays executives, including Bob Diamond, that Diamond rouses himself into an unequivocal denial. Assurances to JPMorgan? There were no assurances, not from Diamond, nor from anyone else at Barclays.

What's clear from Diamond's cloaked admissions, however, is the fact that executives at the highest levels of both firms played a part in the trade of September 18 and 19. And when the official at JPMorgan speaks of the bank feeling deceived, it's clear he means that JPMorgan felt deceived by, among others, Bob Diamond himself.










There are two numbers you have to remember:

The first is $15.8 billion.

The second is $7 billion.

The $15.8 billion is the loan that Barclays extended to Lehman Brothers the night before, when the Fed forced the trade on Barclays. The payment of that loan led JPMorgan to believe it was going to have its way with Barclays — that Barclays was going to take over funding for Lehman Brothers, and also take the collateral JPMorgan was looking to get rid of. The bad stuff.

But a loan of this type has to be renewed every night. And late on Thursday, the back-office guys at JPMorgan notice that Barclays has not renewed the $15.8 billion loan.

A back-office guy at Barclays says that it's just an oversight, and the loan will be renewed. After all, Barclays has more to worry about than a $15.8 billion loan.

Barclays has to worry about the $40 billion. You see, it hasn't gotten the collateral back for it.

And although the Fed is working to keep open the wire — the electronic conduit for securities transfers — time is running out, and it is clear that Barclays is not going to get paid, not tonight anyway. 

For the day, Barclays has sent $45 billion cash to Lehman Brothers via JPMorgan.

It's supposed to get $49.7 billion back in collateral.

It's gotten $42.7 billion.

It's short. 

Barclays is fucked. 

Diamond, it seems, has lost his bet. 

And then, at one in the morning, there's a deal: JPMorgan agrees that it owes Barclays a lot of money. A custodial account is created at JPMorgan for just this purpose. It's Barclays' account. It's Barclays' cash: $7 billion.

Somebody wakes up Friday feeling they've gotten screwed. Take your pick: It could be JPMorgan, when it discovers that Barclays didn't pay the $15.8 billion loan, and Barclays explains that it was under no obligation to do so.

It could be Barclays, when it discovers that JPMorgan has frozen the account with the $7 billion.

So let's change our opening proposition:

Everybody wakes up Friday feeling they've gotten screwed.

And it's still early.

It's about 5:00 A.M., in fact, when Mike Keegan of Barclays tells Alex Kirk of Lehman Brothers that JPMorgan has started to freeze Lehman's assets. Keegan is, like a lot of the people Diamond has brought in to consummate the Lehman purchase, somebody who has been with Diamond a long time. He has, indeed, the honor of having been one of Diamond's first hires at Barclays Capital.

Alex Kirk is a Lehman managing director. Like a lot of the Lehman people who have been brought in to consummate the deal, he has the honor of being with the company only a few months and of being both a newcomer and a survivor. He has been asked by Lehman president Bart McDade to close the trade because Lehman's original closer, its mergers-and-acquisitions guy, quit the day before.

When Keegan tells him about the frozen assets, he tells Keegan, "Call Bob [Diamond] and Rich [Ricci]. Tell them we've got a problem. JPMorgan is not going to close. They're not going to sell you one thing you want."

He is a Lehman person, you see, and like all of the Lehman people, he has dealt with JPMorgan before. In the week leading up to Lehman's bankruptcy, the Lehman people saw how JPMorgan responded when threatened: like a raging, squatting behemoth, "seizing and freezing assets left and right," in the words of another former Lehman managing director.

"JPMorgan doesn't want to save the universe," he says. "JPMorgan wants to profit from the destruction of the universe."

To Lehman guys like Kirk, JPMorgan is nothing but a predator. And so he warns Keegan and Ricci:

You're going to have to rewrite the entire deal.

The deal, of course, is not a handshake agreement. And at the heart of the deal is the list of assets that Barclays has agreed to purchase from Lehman Brothers, consisting of thousands of securities. The list, like everything else in the deal, has to be approved by the bankruptcy-court judge after a hearing.

And the hearing is today, Friday afternoon.

At four o'clock. 

It's now seven in the morning. Kirk is telling Keegan and Ricci that they have to rewrite the asset-purchase agreement in nine hours. That means going back to Lehman's books and finding securities that might actually be worth what Barclays is going to pay.

But the bigger problem is the $7 billion. One of the reasons the trade went slowly the night before was that the collateral that started coming over the wire was not the collateral that Barclays believed it was paying for. 

It wasn't the good stuff, from the Fed.

It was, in the words of a Barclays executive, crap. As in, I know crap when I see crap.

Fortunately for Barclays, some of the Lehman people on hand recognized it. They should. They'd sold it. These were assets that bore the kind of name that historians will decry when they write of the last days of the Era of Expanding Risk:

RACERS.

Restructured Asset Certificates with Enhanced Returns.

They were issued with an Aaa rating from Moody's.

Now they were practically worthless, so worthless in fact that Lehman people had been warning Barclays people about them. Don't take the RACERS... 

So Barclays rejected the collateral that JPMorgan was sending over.

"I don't know if Barclays knew that it was starting a holy war when it refused the collateral," says the former Lehman managing director. "But that's what happened. I think that JPMorgan got pissed because they're usually so clever at doing this stuff. Now it was being done to them."

But JPMorgan has a clever move left because it has the $7 billion — $7 billion is still a lot of money, and JPMorgan holds it hostage. If Barclays wants its money, it has to take the RACERS and pay the $15.8 billion. 

The knife fight in the operating room has begun.










It's Sunday morning, one week after the most powerful bankers in the world tried and failed to save capitalism. That morning, Alex Kirk turns to Bart McDade and says, What are we going to tell people? How are we going to explain this?

What Kirk and McDade fear they are going to have to explain is unusual indeed:

Two days earlier, at a bankruptcy-court hearing that lasted eight hours and ended at close to one in the morning, Judge James Peck had approved the rewritten deal. He'd approved the deal because he deemed it significant to the markets, to "the national economy, and the global economy."

And now Kirk and McDade fear that they won't be able to close it. The deal of the century is on the brink of collapse.

The $7 billion is still frozen.

And JPMorgan won't return Barclays' calls.

Because JPMorgan is furious that Barclays didn't return its calls.

The world is ending in silence.

That night, however, there is an emergency meeting at the offices of Weil Gotshal, Lehman's bankruptcy lawyers. A Barclays contingent led by Rich Ricci is there on one side of the table. They don't even know if JPMorgan is going to show up. But it does, and the common assumption is that the Fed prevailed upon it to do so, at the highest levels. The JPMorgan contingent is led by its general counsel, Stephen Cutler. He looks at the assemblage on the other side and says: You didn't really think you could close without us, did you? 

Some of the people at the meeting remember it for its mayhem — for JPMorgan "trying to bully Rich Ricci," and Ricci showing that he "doesn't bully well," and both sides eventually calling each other thieves.

But one of the lawyers remembers it as a "bunch of bankers yelling about what bankers usually yell about — money." And at the end, there was a settlement — "well, we thought there was a settlement," the lawyer says. 

And so it was that sometime early on Monday morning, September 22, precisely one week after Lehman's bankruptcy filing ended the era of Wall Street expansionism, a trade was completed that began the era of global financial consolidation.

Lehman Brothers NA, the surviving broker-dealer of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings, sent a package of securities to Barclays Capital. Barclays Capital wired back cash, thereby obligating Lehman Brothers NA to pay it back by the terms of the repo contract.

As foreordained, Lehman Brothers NA defaulted. Barclays forgave the debt, taking possession of the company instead.

The trade was closed, and Bob Diamond had his prize, for his price.

One day later, Gerard LaRocca discovered that the $7 billion he thought was in the Barclays account at JPMorgan was no longer there. 

You get the sense that they are still taken aback about what they had to contend with — the furies they unleashed — in their dealings with JPMorgan. They say they would never want to go through something like that again. They say that it was Wall Street hardball at its best and worst. They say that they've gone up against many Wall Street tough guys, but this was something different. This was inappropriate. This was ruthless. This was one firm making a bad situation much worse. This was a Wall Street giant exacerbating the distress of the markets. Sure, there were things that JPMorgan was unhappy about. It was unhappy about the deals it had on the books with Lehman Brothers and so it became unhappy about its deal with Barclays. But there was nothing that Barclays did that could have possibly justified JPMorgan taking its money.

In fact, by taking the money without warning or authorization, JPMorgan did something that was unprecedented. 

But for all that — for all of JPMorgan's ruthlessness — Barclays won at every turn.

They won everything they wanted to win. They got the good stuff. They made sure someone else got the bad. They went by the simple if pitiless principle articulated by Rich Ricci:

"What happened was we then decided very consciously we were only going to take these liabilities, these assets. That's it. The rest of it is in the hands of the bank, of the court, and of the receiver... Now, certainly we're worried about the past and trying to help our clients. But we are under no obligation to settle those things because of the way bankruptcy works. We have the advantage of a clean slate going forward but the disadvantage of trying to deal with Lehman clients who want to talk about the past."

Compare that with how JPMorgan fared. JPMorgan went into the trade looking to unload its worthless Lehman assets, and looking to get Barclays to fund the operations of the Lehman broker-dealer.

Instead, an official speaking for JPMorgan admits, We kept the dregs, and didn't get paid. JPMorgan was not very happy with Barclays Capital.

And so, when the $7 billion went missing, perhaps it was inevitable that Bob Diamond's winning streak would continue. It was shocking to Barclays executives that the Fed wasn't able to just make JPMorgan give it back — wasn't able to convince JPMorgan to right such an obvious wrong. But when the Fed forensically reconstructed the trade and both sides were called upon to settle, Barclays got satisfaction: $1.3 billion in cash and $5.7 billion in securities.

Bob Diamond got everything he wanted, because he knew what he wanted. He named his price, and he got it.










"Was it fun?" I asked Bob Diamond.

It was one of those easy questions he didn't like. Hard questions he could answer with dignity, with his combination of priestly remove and priestly magnanimity. 

The easy questions made him look a little queasy. He blanched a little bit, and his mouth tightened, like the knot of a skinny tie.

"I don't think there's any way you could describe anything we did over that period as fun," he said. "I think, in looking back, there's definitely things that we accomplished that we felt very gratified about — felt, gosh, given the situation, we really executed well. But there was no aspect of it — from the intensity, from vested interests on so many sides, from disagreements with people you trust and know well, to being frankly just plain tired — there was no aspect about it that could be described as fun. But we knew that when we started this process. We got on a plane Thursday night to come to New York. We understood the seriousness. We expected this to be one of the most intense experiences. We felt that if it wasn't something we were prepared to do, we should move aside."

They didn't move aside, of course. At no time did they ever move aside, and now Diamond was an American again. He moved to New York and went to work in the big building at 745 Seventh Avenue, which used to be the headquarters of an American investment bank called Lehman Brothers. Its facade used to throb with the color of lucre — Lehman green, in honor of all those employees who attested that they "bled green" — but now its pulse was Barclays blue. Dick Fuld used to go to work in the carved isolation of the thirty-first floor, but now Bob Diamond's office was made of glass and it was located in the corner of one of his trading floors. He had intended the purchase of Lehman Brothers to be "transformational" for Barclays, and for evidence of his success he didn't have to look much farther than just outside the walls that were his windows and the windows that were his walls. It wasn't just that Barclays Capital was now an American bulge-bracket firm in its own right; it wasn't just that out of the integration of Barclays and Lehman Brothers he had built what Jerry del Missier called a "flow monster" that kept capital moving with incredible efficiency. It was that in taking over Lehman Brothers, he had also allowed Barclays to be taken over, in what one Barclays trader called the "goddamnedest reverse takeover you ever saw." The culture at Lehman Brothers was American and aggressive, replete with its "animals" and its "killers," not to mention its jerks and assholes, and while Diamond cherished the culture he had built at Barclays from the beginning, he was willing to put it in play.

And so I asked him if the purchase of Lehman Brothers had been as transformational for him as it was for Barclays. Of course, being a journalist rather than a capitalist, I was thinking in sentimental terms — thinking that he might answer by speaking of what he'd lost, in terms of innocence, rather than what he'd gained, in terms of power and prestige. But his answer was right in front of me, as well as all around me. His jacket was off, slung on a chair. He was wearing a blue-striped shirt, with a green tie dotted with tiny emblems in the shape of Nantucket, where his father had once been the high school principal, and where he was flying that evening in a NetJet to spend the summer weekend at his mansion. His whole being was transformed and his innocence was the innocence of acquisition. He was transformed exactly as Barclays had been, and when, two weeks later, Barclays Capital announced — largely on the strength of its Lehman acquisition — a half-year profit of nearly $2 billion, Diamond's staid English bank stood with JPMorgan as one of the biggest investment banks in the world... or, as Ricci would have it, as "one of the big boys, for better or for worse."

Lost Cat

Almost two years ago I lost my cat Gattino. He was very young, still a kitten, at seven months barely an adolescent. He is probably dead but I don’t know for certain. For two weeks after he disappeared people claimed to have seen him; I trusted two of the claims because Gattino was blind in one eye, and both people told me that when they’d caught him in their headlights, only one eye shone back. One guy, who said he saw my cat trying to scavenge from a garbage can, said that he’d looked ‘really thin, like the runt of the litter’. The pathetic words struck my heart. But I heard something besides the words, something in the coarse, vibrant tone of the man’s voice that immediately made another emotional picture of the cat: back arched, face afraid but excited, brimming and ready before he jumped and ran, tail defiant, tensile and crooked. Afraid but ready; startled by a large male, that’s how he would’ve been. Even if he was weak with hunger. He had guts, this cat.

Gattino disappeared two and a half months after we moved. Our new house is on the outskirts of a college campus near a wildlife preserve. There are wooded areas in all directions, and many homes with decrepit outbuildings sit heavily, darkly low behind trees, in thick foliage. I spent hours at a time wandering around calling Gattino. I put food out. I put a trap out. I put hundreds of flyers up. I walked around knocking on doors, asking people if I could look in their shed or under their porch. I contacted all the vets in the area. Every few days, someone would call and say they had seen a cat in a parking lot or behind their dorm. I would go and sometimes glimpse a grizzled adult melting away into the woods, or behind a building, or under a parked car.

After two weeks there were no more sightings. I caught three feral cats in my trap and let them go. It began to snow. Still searching, I would sometimes see little cat tracks in the snow; near dumpsters full of garbage, I also saw prints made by bobcats or coyotes. When the temperature went below freezing, there was icy rain. After a month I stopped looking. Nearly every day I sat and looked out the window at the field across from our house, tears running down my face.

Six months after Gattino disappeared my husband and I were sitting in a restaurant having dinner with some people he had recently met, including an intellectual writer we both admired. The writer had considered buying the house we were living in and he wanted to know how we liked it. I said it was nice but it had been partly spoiled for me by the loss of our cat. I told him the story and he said, ‘Oh, that was your trauma, was it?’

I said yes. Yes, it was a trauma.

You could say he was unkind. You could say I was silly. You could say he was priggish. You could say I was weak.

Microsoft has a message it wants you to take away when you look at its new hardware: Your laptop is for getting work done, your tablet is for playing, and the Surface Pro 3 is the device that will supplant them both.

The company unveiled the new portable touchscreen computer at a press event in New York today. The newest model in the Surface line is both bigger and more powerful than previous versions: 12 inches (up from 10.6) though still remarkably thin, and loaded with the latest Intel Core processors. The Core i5 versions will ship in June, with other configurations shipping before the end of August.

Which is almost enough time to save up the money you’ll need to buy one. Pricing starts at $800 for the Core i3 version. A fully-loaded i7 device with the best storage options sits just shy of $2,000. And that’s without the keyboard case, an essential add-on that costs an extra $130.

That’s super-pricey for a tablet. But the new Surface is not just a tablet. Microsoft’s presenters, which included CEO Satya Nadella and Corporate VP for Surface Computing Panos Panay, were relentless in their hammering of this point during the event.

According to consumer research quoted by Microsoft, 96 percent of iPad owners also own a laptop – a statistic the company says points to fundamental differences in the ways people use each device.

“Tablets are designed for you to sit back and watch movies, read books, browse the web, snacking on apps,” Surface chief Panay said during the event. “Laptops are not designed that way at all… They’re designed for editing, they’re designed for making. There’s a design point, and they’re made that way for a reason.”

And then tablets weren’t mentioned much at all after that.

Instead, Panay focused on the ways the new Surface Pro stacks up to laptops. At 0.35 inches (9.1mm) thick, Microsoft claims the Surface Pro 3 is the thinnest Intel Core i7 device ever made. Panay twice placed the new Surface Pro on a scale – and once dropped it to showcase its resilience. He was also quick to note how much thinner and lighter it is compared to the MacBook Air: 1.7 pounds, compared to 2.38 pounds for Apple’s 11-inch laptop.

So the point of all this is that the Surface Pro 3 is much lighter than a laptop, but more of a workhorse than an iPad. That’s not a departure from previous versions of Surface Pro. Nor is the fact that it runs Windows 8.1 Professional, giving it the ability to run full desktop apps. With this edition, however, the company has honed the hardware to make it even more laptop-like than before. Not exactly thick, but thicker than you’d expect a tablet to be. Still, it’s an incredibly light load in your bag.

The new Surface’s larger display splits the difference between that of a tablet and a laptop: At 12 inches diagonally, its tack-sharp 2160-by-1440 screen looks great. It also has a 3:2 aspect ratio instead of 16:9, which is a better shape for laptopping, but a bit awkward for tabletting. The extra real estate shines, however, when you’re using the Surface Pro 3 in desktop mode—as you would a laptop—giving multiple open windows much more room to breathe. New design and engineering touches also enhance the laptop-like experience. It has a back-mounted kickstand like its predecessors, but it’s a completely reengineered version of the hinge that allows for about 130 degrees of motion with the ability to lock sturdily at every point along the way. The Surface Pro 3 isn’t fanless, but it’s close to silent. Little vent holes are hidden around the edges of the device, and a paper-thin fan circulates air inside the Surface Pro to keep the CPU cool.

Most of these hardware tweaks have served to make the Surface more laptoppy, but one tablet-like element has been added: Its touch-sensitive Start button has been moved so it sits at the bottom of the device in portrait mode rather than landscape mode.

Although Apple has traditionally shunned the use of styli on its own touchscreen devices, Microsoft is embracing the idea with its own Bluetooth pen that ships with each configuration of the Surface 3, even the cheap ones. Using the pen, you can input handwritten text that can be converted (via OCR technology) to type. This works in productivity apps, as well as fun ones such as the New York Times Crossword. Adobe VP of Experience Design Michael Gough was also on-stage to show how the pen and multi-touch gestures have been programmed into an upcoming version of Photoshop optimized for Surface.

So even while playing up how laptop-like the Surface is in terms of performance, screen design, and built-in software features, it’s still missing the one thing that leads most people to purchase a laptop instead of a tablet: a keyboard.

Microsoft makes its own keyboard for Surface, the TypeCover, which magnetically attaches to the bottom edge. There’s a new TypeCover (an extra $130) which has a much larger trackpad and a second magnetic strip to prop the keys up at a more comfortable angle while it’s sitting on your lap. It works extremely well; a sure improvement. The keys react nicely, the trackpad works fine, and the positioning is more comfortable this time around, but it’s still not the same thing as a real keyboard. There’s also a desktop dock (sold separately for $200) which looks cool and lets you use the Surface Pro with full-on peripherals.

The Surface Pro 3 looks like an amazing computer, but it may ultimately be a superb foundation for the world’s best thin-and-light laptop. With a light-but-sturdy clamshell design and a solid metal keyboard, it would be one hell of a competitor to the MacBook Air. But all the comparisons to laptops Microsoft tossed out at the launch event just served to remind us that it wasn’t one. The fact that the Surface is still Wi-Fi only with no 4G option, and the silence surrounding the future of Windows RT — the version of Windows optimized for ARM processors in cheaper touchscreen devices — served as hints that Microsoft had all but given up on the tablet-as-tablet experience.

Perhaps 96 percent of Surface Pro 3 owners will also buy an iPad.
